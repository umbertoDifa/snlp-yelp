This is one of my favourite finds in the city!! And what a find!

Hidden away in the depths of Charlotte Square, this place doesn't look like much. It's got such a lovely, authentic atmosphere though, really genuine and comforting.

It's really traditional and a great place to come if you would like a relaxing, authentic atmosphere.  Yes it's a bit cave-like, but it's an experience!
When you go (which you will) you won't be disappointed, and you'll be back (alongside Arnold)I had the fish soup when I came here (thinking along the lines of Cullen Skink...seafood showder...etc etc) but it was DISGUSTING. It tasted like a fish had gone into the blender, skin, bones, eyes and all, and put into a bowl. I had about 3 sips and couldn't eat any more. My friends also didn't enjoy their food either, one had venison (which was chewy) and the other had duck (which was rubbery). I'm just back from Paris, and can say with total confidence that this is nothing like it!When I was growing up, the closest cinema to me was a 30 minute car journey away, and that cinema only had one screen and was about three months behind everywhere else, so if I wanted to see something in particular I would have to travel at least 2hours to get to one of the mega-complex cinemas. As a result, I tend to look at smaller, less appreciated cinemas with a sense of fondness, cinema's like the Cameo in Tolcross.
Ok, it doesn't look like much but the 50s style 'Now Showing' board at the front adds character for what it lacks in structure. The red velvet curtains and gold-plaited popcorn boxes bring back fond memories for me, and was a novelty to my friends. It has become retro - not because they have slaved over the decor, but because it simply hasn't changed.

The cinemas themselves are beautiful, the main one is huge with curving rows of seats. It's really nice to go to a traditional cinema now and again. They show all the new releases, as well as some less-known edgy indie films. There's something for everyone at the cameo.

It's worth going to the Cameo to see that film that you were going to go to the Omni centre for . Why, I hear you ask? Why not? It's a different experience, same film. It's not that comfortable if the film is long, and the huge rooms make it easy to get cold, but it's really pleasant.I love the Stand comedy club! When it's good, it's really really good and when it's bad it's still quite good! They have a great variety of comedians in here, I once saw Frankie Boyle for £1. The venue is in a great location, but it is a bit small. There's a high chance you will get crammed in a table at the back and not be able to see much. The bar is near the entrance, so if you get thirsty during a show then on your head be it - you'll have to walk right through the entire audience. As it is quite a small club, and is underground, it gets very hot very quickly.

I was taken here once on a first date. The guy was sporting a black eye (from rugby) and a pink shirt. We were like textbook comedy, and of course we sat in the front row. The whole first date, pink shirt and black eye thing was the theme of the evening. If you're not the centre of the jokes, it's great fun, but not so much if you are!
I didn't call black eyed pink shirt man back after he referred to me as his 'woman' . ehhh no.It's a lovely place to celebrate the mantra of a wonderful wee doggy!

It's very traditional, would appeal to tourists and is rather quaint!

Rather expensive too!I agree with Alice, it's not somewhere that I go often but find it really enjoyable when I do go.
It's got a great bar and the staff are really friendly, as well as really handsome (well, the men anyway)

It's definitely a good place to come to have a laugh with your friends, it's god a good atmosphere and is always a fun place to be.The Villager is one of those really cool places in Edinburgh with dark lighting. You just know it's cool if it has dark lighting.

I met my brothers girlfriend for the first time in this restaurant. She is one of those annoyingly beautiful girls who always looks amazing and is really lovely. Tsuh. She chose the restaurant and so I knew it would be a good'un. As I said, it is really cool and the food is delicious! Really tasty and nice food, I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the food. It is good food with a twist - I had a really yummy duck burger for lunch once, and I had a delicious Brie tarte for dinner during another visit. Their menu changes regularly so it's worth paying another visit. I look forward to it! It's the sort of place I would go to buy an entire new outfit for. Inc. jewelery.

There is also always a really good offer online for The Villager, which is useful to lower the price a bit!I live at the bottom of Holyrood Road, and believe me there is NOTHING to do down there if you live in Edinburgh. But, after staring out my window at the opera-esq style building, I had to give in. Yes, I'm 20, but I was really excited for my day out! I went with my then-boyfriend and we got great student discount - it was about £4 each to get in. Ok, I'll admit it, it was quite childish going into the time machine, but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed myself! I had thought that the whole thing would be aimed at kids and purely educational, but I was really surprised at how mature the whole thing was and was actually quite fun at times. As well as this, there was quite a big emphasis on Edinburgh, which I quite liked as you don't often get the chance to find out about the geology of your city. Ok, I realise how sad that sounds...

I suppose I enjoyed it more than my then-boyfriend because I am studying Geography, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It took us about an hour and a half to walk through. The stars/sky thing at the end did make me feel a bit dizzy, but it was a great experience. As I said, I look out at the building every day and can see their new displays which seem to change every other week, keeping it modern and exciting for locals as well as tourists! Whether you are a tourist looking to find out more about Edinburgh or a local, it's definitely worth a visit!

I should probably mention that you shouldn't buy anything from the cafe, but I don't think any sensible person would in touristy places like Dynamic EarthI came here recently for a conference. I always knew Dynamic Earth was used as a venue but never got to experience it. And it makes for a stunning corporate venue.

There are many rooms to make use of, for workshops and presentations. They have a great system for lunch, there was about 200 people at the event yet there were no queues and the layout was brilliant. The food was really good too - I was expecting something totally drab and unexciting. As it was a sunny day, we got to use the outdoor patios for our coffee, it was lovely!

I was told that you can get married here too. I would turn my nose up at that prospect, but now that I've seen what else it has to offer, I would consider it.This place is legendary!! When I told my granny I was going to be living and studying in Edinburgh, she was positively giddy as it meant I could post her down crombie's produce. pfft.

but I totally understand. The meat here is so good, as Amy G says it's hard to go back to eating any other sort of meat.  Their beef olives are a particular favourite of mine, particularly with haggis - yummmmmy! Also they make really good burgers, with BBQ season looming you can easily come here and fob them off as your own.
They can also make things to order too! If you need a certain amount of Steaks, or perhaps a pig's head, they can get it to you within the week.
Although I'm not quite sure why anybody would need a pig's head. Each to their own.I had a friend who used to work here, and she would eat off the plates when she was taking them away....that used to freak me out.

So this is your bog-standard TGI Friday's. To be honest, the atmosphere on a Friday is decidedly less as exciting as I would have expected. I've been a couple times and my over-all reaction is 'meh' . I think that sums it up. If you're looking for chicken wings, chilli-burgers, nachos and ribs, then you've hit the jackpot - but otherwise.....meh

The cocktails were quite sickly too, but I got a free glass out of it. I am easily bought, and a huge TGI Friday glass did the trick.The neon sign kinda put me off a little bit, but I always heard amazing things about Bo's. I struggled too at first with the idea of going to a vegetarian restaurant - I like my meat. But I was pleasantly surprised!!

The pasta was delicious - I just knew it was too good and I would have to slog it off at the gym the next day. But tasty doesn't quite give it justice!!

The place itself doesn't excite me too much, but it's nice and a good place to come for vegetarian friends. Definitely one to keep in mind.This hotel looks a lot nicer from the outside than it does from the inside....!!

It looks somewhat mysterious from the outside, and inside it's got all the signs of a slightly run-down, 90s hotel. yeah it's nice, but it has that musty smell you can never shift.

The staff are lovely though, you can't fault them for service. It would benefit greatly from a lick of paint and some love!Thistle Street is one of my favourite places to dine out in Edinburgh, it's quirky, it's quaint and most importantly, the food is amazing. Cafe Marlayne is no exception to this!

It's mainly French cuisine and is fine dining at its best, yet has a really nice chilled atmosphere. The prices are staggeringly good for the quality you're getting.
I had a garlic and something with steak,and it was delicious!! Although I wasn't snogging anyone in a hurry.

The menus are my favourite, they're all hand-written! Such a nice touchI had never tried Hoummas and falafel until that fateful day I wandered into Nile Valley. The layout is small and not very appealing, but when you get downstairs it's a whole new vibe. The African theme runs throughout the decor and the people, everyone is so welcoming and happy. They have a great selection of wraps that they make right infront of you and they are YUMMY!! Hoummas and Falafel especially is my favourite, and I've worked my way through a few different flavours. Each wrap is around £3 and there's a great student discount.
Nile Valley, I salute youEvery Christmas, my mum and I get butterflies about going to The Dome. If you've seen the Christmas wreaths wrapped around the pillars, you'll begin to see why, and if you go inside you will understand completely. It's like they have a room spray of all the Christmas smells and keep it constantly puffing out in plooms of fairy dust and laughter. Every year I have to catch my breath when I go into The Dome, because it is quite simply breathtaking. The decoration is beautiful and the whole atmosphere is electric.

Even when it's not Christmas, The Dome just has a magical feeling about it. It's like a fairytale. Yeah it's a bit pricey but worth every penny. You can't go to somewhere like The Dome and not expect to pay for it. It's also a hot-spot for celeb-spotting (although the amount of celebrities in Edinburgh is extremely limited).La Tasca kinda gets a bad name, but I quite like it!! I know more than a few people who slate it because they think it's greasy and not up to scratch, 'Real Spanish food doesn't come in boxes' has been said more than once. So what, it's a franchise, but the food isn't bad!! It's quite a nice way to ease yourself into Mediterranean food if you ask me.

Price is good too!! There's always a decent offer on the internet for La Tasca, worth a look.This place is heaven on earth. Seriously, they should turn it into a Church on Sundays, it's simply bliss.
It is so modern and chic. All the rooms are amazing, they are beautifully furnished and so very, very cool. The food is delicious too, the breakfast in particular is to die for. I asked the waiter how they made their scrambled eggs, because they were unlike any i've ever had before! I wish I hadn't asked - his answer of 'double cream' and 'full fat butter' actually made my bum cheeks sag.
whenever I have friends coming to the city, I recommend they stay here. Party because it's amazing, but mainly because it means I can come and have breakfast with them.

It is a bit out of the way, but the area is lovely and there are great transport links. Plus it's beside some really lovely restaurants, so who needs to be in the city centre!Oh Greggs. I owe you one.

I've lost count of the amount of times this place has sorted me out. It's hangover food essentially, but damn good hangover food!! They have brilliant sandwiches that are all made fresh daily, and their cakes are yummy. Their sausage rolls are what save my life.

To be honest, this isn't one of my preferred branches.It's in the St James' centre, so everyone watches you. I don't like the St james' centre and as much as I love Greggs, I avoid this one!I came here once upon a time whilst looking for somewhere reasonably cheap and quick during a study break.  The first thing that struck me is the canteen-like interior, stainless steel tables and food on the floor. But I had arrived just after the lunch-time rush so I understood and forgave. 

I had a tuna nicoise salad, which was lovely!! My friend had a mozzarella panini, which she sad was a bit greasy but good nevertheless. My salad was £6 and her panini was £2.75, so it wasn't too expensive and I was stuffed all day!

It is in a great location for students, and great for those who just want a sandwich.I was once taken here by an ex whilst trying to win me back. He thought the way to my heart was to throw money at me and give me expensive food. I think his mantra was echoing that of the restaurant itself. Its reputation preceded my visit, so I was expecting the best dinner I've ever had (which is why I said yes to the invitation!). But I found the whole experience less than enjoyable. The menu was very fancy , verging on uncomfortable and the wine list was bigger than the majority of my textbooks. And I have a lot of text-books. If you are a wine buff then you'd love it, but I was happy with a glass of sauvignon - imagine my surprise when I had to specify from which world (old or new), which country, which area, which vineyard. I was expecting to be asked to specify the grape.

So, the Witchery has a very strong reputation in Edinburgh as being the best restaurant, and I can see why. It looks fancy, it tastes fancy, the price was fancy! But, again, I wasn't impressed. To win me over, you need to prove your worth. Sadly, both my ex and the Witchery failed to do so.Ok, I take what I said back.  Sortof. The food is really really really good, you can't deny it, and the service is immaculate and the surroundings are amazing. 

But there's still that one thing holding me back from giving it the 5*.....I still don't know what it is...something isn't quite right...Biblos is a brilliant bar/restaurant in a great location for students and professionals. The bar is really trendy and attracts passers-by with its huge bay-windows and comfy furniture. Their food is good too - their menu features such treats as nachos, burgers and balmoral chicken! Depending on your appetite you can have small or large portions. I can highly recommend the chicken nachos - but ask for n jalepenos o if you don't like them! They have a great discount if you have a SR card - buy one get one free - and when big events such as X factor and britains Got Talent are on you can watch them here - just make sure you don't sit behind a pillar!Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves!

This yacht has a lot of history, and if you're looking for a historical tour of Edinburgh then this is a must! It is anchored (permanently) down at Leith, and so is part of the Ocean Terminal complex. I would be complaining about how far out it is, but it is really easy to get to with all the tourist busses driving past and a regular public bus going here every ten minutes or so. And it's easy to drive to, with free parking!

Personally, this sort of thing doesn't usually float my boat (HAHA get it?) but I did quite enjoy my recent trip here with my grandparents. Although I did burst my lip with the walky-talky things you get as part of the tour. My grandparents loved it and took hours to get around the ship. 

Furthermore, as it is part of Ocean Terminal you are spoilt for choice with all the food-courts and shops available. It's a nice place to spend the day, but as I said it is very far out of the way.This is one of my favourite branches...nae my favourite coffee shops full stop! Big statement, eh! Let me explain...

This particular street is much less hustly and bustly from the rest of the area because it's pedestrianized (well, most of it is). There are no cars so it's quieter, safer and all round more enjoyable.

The shop itself is really nice, your bog-standard Costa but with a little more attention to detail in the layout. The quality of the coffee and food goes without saying, I think this branch serves some of the better coffee compared to other high street branches. 

In the summer this place is always packed oot! They have a lovely outdoor seating area. Whenever I go shopping, I start at the far end of Princes Street at Frasers and make my way across, and this Costa is in prime position for my 11am coffee.I've noticed that a lot of my yelp's begin with 'i went on a date here once' ...and this is no different...

So, I went on a date here once! The first thing that struck me was the size - it is huge! But really nicely decorated. It looks out onto the canal (yeah, I didn't know there was a canal in Edinburgh either) and has a lovely outdoor seating area.

BUT..... I've been a few times at the weekend and it's always absolutely dead! There is no atmosphere and hardly anybody there! As a result all the drinks were extortionately priced - but as I was on a date I didn't have to pay (score!) . The mojito's were good....not the best but ok, definitely not worth £8 each.

Overall, it's a nice place but has no atmosphere. If you like a bit of life in a bar, don't hit Cargo!When you google 'Mexican Edinburgh' , Pancho Villas is quite far down on the page, but it shouldn't be. Yes, it's a franchise, and yes, it's not the most glamorous  of places, but it is one of my favourites in Edinburgh. There is definitely an atmosphere in this restaurant -  a cosy, welcoming and happy one reflected in the service and on the faces of other customers. Straight away you know you've got a good one. Ok, so the surroundings aren't considered chic, but it's quaint. 

But let's get down to business - the food. It would be hard to get Mexican food wrong, right? They couldn't get it wrong in Pancho's , every single dish is as mouth-watering as the last. I don't think I've ever spent so long choosing what to have, usually the best option jumps out at you. I considered ordering 3 dishes during one of my visits because I simply couldn't choose. I would highly recommend the  burrito - either chicken or beef (well...on the menu it's 'spicy chicken' or 'spicy beef' - i'm a spice pussy and I can eat it quite happily). The only criticism I personally have is with presentation - they tend to put sala, guacamole and sour cream on top of the tortilla which I find messy and unbalanced...but hey that's personal.
the fajitas are amongst the best I've ever had. 

So, what I'm trying to say is, if you are looking for a nice, cosy place to sit in with your boyfriend/girlfriend/lover/mistress/son/daughter/family/wheoever, and you can't be bothered changing from your hoody and trackies, go to Pancho Villas. you will get great food, a good atmosphere, and even better cocktails. what's not to want?Ok so I ordered the wrong thing when I came here last time. I meant to order the quesadilla but ended up with a burrito. Not a bad thing, but my buds weren't ready.

The staff wern't very attentive this time, we had to order our drinks at the bar and they came and took our order when the drinks had arrived. It was fine though.

The food was still good! The wine was a bit warm, but that's ok.  
It's never really busy here, don't know why but it isn't!I love art galleries, and I love the Fruitmarket Gallery. When I was in 1st year I chose to study History of Art, so my lectures were always in galleries and I fell in love with this one. It is so different from your bog-standard art gallery with the likes of Rubens, Raphael and Seurat, but the Fruitmarket has modern and interpretive art - which I love. They have really brilliant, exciting exhibitions and always have a theme. the last exhibition I visited was all about America, but not what you would expect.  They showed a cowboy and indian movie on a huge plasma screen over-looking the gallery 24/7 at super slow speed - I'll never forget queuing to get into a club and looking up to see an Indian towering over me.

The gift shop is great too, they don't have much but they have good things. They have a really nice little cafe too, it's always busy. Although the gallery is quite small it's still worth a visit.I'm always intruiged to come into the cuckoo's nest as from the outside it looks kinda cool. One of those diamonds in the rough! So when I eventually got round to going in , my suspicions were confirmed. 

It's surprisingly cool! The upstairs bar is quite small but chic nevertheless. If you want a quiet drink then I would thoroughly recommend you come here mid-week. It gets really busy at the weeknds, probably because they have £2 cocktails. 
When they have a drinks deal on it's the place to be if you're counting the pennies, but if not then it is quite pricey.I agree with Fiona - it's not bad, but it's not great either.
Centotre is sort of like the sheepish kid in the back row not really saying much while all the big kids shout and play. How's that for an analogy!!

Everything is very samey samey. The decor is lovely though, they have the circle theme throughout, and bright, bold panels of pink. They have great cocktails though, and the staff take their duties very seriously.
They always have lots to do though - I think they try to make up in entertainment what they lack in va va voom. Check out their website for all the latest events!

The website is brilliant too - they have heaps of cocktail recipes and a good sense of humour.i am one of the biggest advocators or Starbucks....ok I know to some coffee-lovers that's hen-us, but I love the chilled atmosphere and the friendly staff and the good products. However this branch isn't one I would recommend. It's small, the staff are a bit nippy, and the tables are never clean. Plus it's always really busy.I agree with Gibson A, the service, food and price are all flawless!!

It's got such a strong atmosphere, you'll struggle to find one like this  anywhere else. The staff are LOVELY, I feel proud to be able to give them credit on here because they deserve it.

The music is a bit dodgy though, I would have preferred something a bit more upbeat but hey, can't get everything right!!

I had the noodles with chicken in a pak choi sauce or something like that, and it was delicious. Really fragrant and really tasty! And reasonable!! I'll be backI agree with Alice's review - even though I am a student, I HATE Po Na Na because it has such a 'yah' atmosphere. The students in here give students like me a bad name!!

I once heard stories that Scottish people were refused entry into Po Na Na, and I can quite believe it. It markets itself as an entirely English club. What's up with that?! What's more my ex-flatmate used to work here and she said that if the punters won't notice, don't give them vodka in their drinks but charge them for it anyway! WHAT?!

all the staff in here are what I would call 'beautiful people'  - they all look good but they are very much aware of it.

My mum came to Po Na NA once on a hen-party and even she said she felt uncomfortable.

Po Na Na? let's forget the 'Po' and you've got my feelings exactly about this club.Edinburgh is quite a spooky city. It has a history, lots of horror stories such as Burke and Hare, and so the Edinburgh Dungeon is one of the scariest! 

The lay-out is typical of most dungeons, blood seeping through the walls, creepy music and ominous dark curtains everywhere. The staff are brilliant, they really get into it and include people in the show. I prefer it when people are included, it gives you a sense of being part of it, rather than just watching a show. There is a really cool (but really scary) boat-ride as part of the trip, I am one of those people who jumps at anything, including sneezes, ringing phones and creaks. And I jumped at all 3 in the Edinburgh dungeon.

At times I felt it was a bit over-rehearsed and a bit boring, but overall it was a great experience and I would thoroughly recommend it.The smell of this baked potato shop drives me crazy. You know how some people say that oysters is an aphrodisiac? I would argue that the smells wafting out of Tempting Tattie would weaken the knees of the most upstanding gentleman/lady.

They have a great selection of fillings - everything you would expect from a baked potato shop. The potatoes themselves are nothing short of perfect - exactly how a tattie should be. I loved the tuna mayo and sweetcorn, it's really chilled and so works well with the steamy potato. My friend just had cheese and she said it was the best baked potato she'd ever had.I came here for the first time at New Year 2008/2009, and was so impressed with it that I've lost count of the amount of times I've been back.
It is your typical Rose Street pub but a bit classier. They have really cool furniature and really nice decor, it's one of the trendier places to be. When I came at new year I asked the lady behind the bar to give me something festive and she gave me a drink that literally tasted like christmas. It was warm and tasted like apples and cinnamon. YUM!!

The price isn't too bad either!! The only criticism I do have is that their wine isn't that cold, I'm a sucker for a nice cool glass of wine. But it's nice to sit outside and watch the world go by too!! I wish they had more outdoor seats though, but hey, it's lovely inside!Edinburgh Woollen Mill.....doesn't really affect my life too much!
It's a nice touristy place to come if you're into the whole Scottish cashmere thing, but otherwise it won't affect your life too much. It's a great place for what it is - pashminas and scarves left, right and centre, and all the colours you could ever ask for. It's good quality too, I bought a navy scarf here a few years ago and still get good use out of it.

But as I say....it won't make a huge impact on your life! Pleasant enough though!I really like going to Pizza Express - the food is brilliant. So let's start here. Whenever I go I  either have the tuna salad or chicken pesto pasta with red onion - the latter is delicious but the former is better for the hips. The wine is always freezing, which I absolutely love and the staff are friendly.

So, I assumed that all branches of this restaurant would be the same! But I'm sad to report this particular branch wasn't so great. The staff barely noticed my table and took about 25 minutes to take a drink order. I wouldn't mind, but the restaurant was dead. Their wine, which is usually freezing, was quite warm and the food was burnt. I was really disappointed in the Queensferry overall experience, but it didn't put me off Pizza Express in general.Wow!!! Global make amazing sandwiches. Fact. They have a really good menu and great staff, I had such a laugh as I was waiting for my chicken Panini. The guy making it said he would add in some extra;s, if I didn't mind. I battered my eyelids and blushed, of course not, handsome sandwich man with sexy accent!!

The only thing that puts me off Global is the location....I find it difficult to eat and walk, I prefer to sit down somewhere comfortable and enjoy my lunch, but being where it is I had to go find a bench. ok it wasn't difficult to find one, but kinda wish it was closer to my flat. Ok that's selfish, but handsome sandwich man had a VERY sexy accent.The Hebrides Bar is exactly what you would expect from a train-station local....very localised! The punters all knew each other when I came in for a quick tipple with my mum before going to London, and we were met with silence and watched until we had taken our seat. There was no effort to make us feel welcome, or even comfortable.

Upon speaking to my friends about Hebrides bar, they were surprised as they have had really good experiences in the bar - at the weekend and late at night! I'm planning on going back at the weekend to see if it will change my mind....but I don't have high hopesOk, I know it's a bit weird to be reviewing a street, but I  love Thistle Street. What's not to love??! It has the most amazing restaurants and the best atmosphere in the whole city. This is the sort of place that yelp is made for, you wouldn't necessarily notice the narrow, unassuming street unless you were loooking for it.

Cafe Marlyane is a lovely French restaurant, and Fishers in the City is one of the best fish restaurants i've ever been to.

The narrow cobbled streets make it one of my favourite places to eat in the whole of EdinburghI came here during one of the festivals free comedy shows, and I'm not gonna lie I felt a little bit intimidated! It is a lovely pub yeah, and I agree with everyone below me - maybe I just went on a bad day. I was getting eyed up and down (and I thought I looked normal!) and felt a bit like Truman from The Truman Show.I came on a Friday night, so maybe avoid that one.  
Anyway, when I was sitting down it was much better, nice atmosphere and the drinks were relatively cheap.  The food menu looked great too, I made a promise with my friends that we would come back for a lunch or something.
As a venue, it was really small. We were all crammed in and felt a bit like Sardines. But then again it was the free festival, and they were letting the performers in without charging them, which I thought was lovely!It's sitting on the Royal Mile, so it's not going to be Little Italy.

It's a nice enough place, with a warm welcome (from Gordon himself, if you're lucky) and nice enough decor. A bit dated, but hey. The food is questionable....I've eaten here a few times and tried to vary what I have, but it all tastes the same - bland! The Spaghetti Carbonarra is faaar too creamy for my liking (and my hips didn't thank me) and the meat can be chewy. I don't know why  I come back here, I think it's because my Dad likes it - but he likes Ronan Keating, so y'know....George Square is the playground for Edinburgh Uni students (and skateboarders) and so it was only natural that a cheap and trendy restaurant would open looking over the square. Step in Assembly!
It is a really nice student restaurant. They have comfy couches and slouchy sofas to sit and relax all day long. As a result, it is always really really busy and if you try to get some lunch at 1ish, you'll be lucky. Their menu is really cheap - everything is under £5! Brilliant! I can highly recommend both the Assembly salad and the Thai Beef Salad, as well as their panini's and nachos. 
As I said, it is a student-haven, so if you don't like to mingle amongst the Universities finest yah's then maybe visit in the afternoon or evening, by which time they should all have gone back to New-Town to back-comb their hair.Yes, Tonic has the best cocktails in Edinburgh!!

It is a really modest place, it's really not flash yet always has a brilliant atmosphere. To get here you have to go down some stairs, and the bar itself is really quite small. It can therefore get really uncomfortable when it's busy, you can't get to the bar and the wait is made twice as long as the waiters are meticulous with their cocktails. I once had a cocktail in an actual jam jar!
My brothers girlfriend and I spent about 30minutes looking over the extensive menu to decide what we were going to have. When we decided, we both wanted what the other was having so ended up doing a swap.
This is definitely one of the gems in the city!What a great sandwich shop! The name first got me interested in the shops - what an odd combination - but I think that's precisely what they were going for. An odd combination! You can have anything your heart desires in this small-ish bagel shop. I always have a simple ham and cream cheese on a poppyseed bagel with pomegranates and it's delicious. My only criticism is how difficult it is to eat the darn things! I used to nip across here when I was in the University Orchestra and i would always have to take myself to the bathroom, shamefully with pomegranate all down my front. 

I would definitely advise you take-away too, because in all the times I've been I've never once seen a seat free.My mum absolutely loves coming here every Sunday for their pub quiz....and you know what? So do I! 

Let's look at the facts....a seedy looking old-man's pub in the heart of tourist-land in Edinburgh - yeah, I wasn't too keen either. But I learnt my lesson...the same lesson I learnt that fateful night watching Susan Boyle on Britains Got Talent - never judge a book by its cover.

Yeah it's a tradtional pub and yeah you can tell the clientele have been going there for years. When my mum and I first started going to the pub quiz we were greeted somewhat coldly, but once they realised we had no general knowledge and positively sucked at World Geography, we got a few more smiles.

So, overall it's a brilliant pub and has a great quiz every Sunday. Look out for my mum and I in the corner, we'll be the ones making our way through the wineThis reminds me of my days in school when we would go on wee trips and need snacks for the bus. You could get 12 cookies for like £2! Bargain! So everyone always had a bag with them.
My favourite was always the white chocolate chip - absolutely delicious and gooey! One of them is great, two is good and three is the limit. Once you've had more than 2 you're playing a dangerous game with your tummy. They make everyone feel sick after a while, I've lost count of the amount of stops we had to make on those school trips!
So although their cookies are delicious and great value, they are sickly sweet! If you see a Millie's cookie stand, buy a cookie solo - yeah it won't be the best value for money but it's the best thing here.The first time I came here I was quite hungover - what better to cure a hangover than a nice big plate of meat, right? Wrong....

The name 'Gourmet Burger' should have told me that this isn't your average burger place. They pour their heart and soul into their burgers, and it shows. The price, to begin with, is extreme!! The cheapest burger was £14.95. They did have  great selection though, and it was nice when I went back a second time to experiment with their mint and avocado chicken burger.

I was a bit surprised too when I had to order at the bar and pay there and then.....I thought the standard they were trying to impose was one that included table-service....ach well!! It was nice though!Agreeing with Marj, what else can I say?! the £2 sub attracts the crowds and pleases one and all (sorry, I've been watching the muskateers). The staff are lovely, genuinely want to help you and are very good at their job. The service is quick and the sub is good, for the money you spend on it anyway!This place opened up with high hopes! It looked cool, it was in a cool location and the bar-staff were hot - the perfect formula right?

I came for food with my dad once - the selection was awful, we had a choice of 2 dishes and that was that - duck or chicken. Inventive! The drinks were good though, a bit expensive but good nevertheless. I had a cosmopolitan and the glass was really funky, I felt like I was a child again with a funky straw!
Full of yah's thoughI have to admit - I was surprised when I saw the really good reviews below me, so I had to take everything they have said into account....but I didn't like it so much! 
I wouldn't say I was an especially big meat-eater - I don't really like red meat but I must admit I missed it in here.

The restaurant is lovely though, very swish. Yeah, I used the word swish.

For a vegeterian, it is brilliant. I've lost count of the amount of times my vegeterian friends have had to settle for the only one option on a menu they can eat, but in here they can have their pick!

I think I might have had the same curry as Jay V below me, but I really didn't like it. It's all about preferences I suppose.

For vegeterians - BRILLIANT
For everyone else - MehSometimes it's  nice to get out of Edinburgh for a couple hours, but sometimes you can't. When I feel like this, I always nip up to the royal mile to this starbucks. You could literally be anywhere in the world! It attracts such a wide range of customers, from tourists to rich business men to politicians. The view is just of the lower half of the cannongate so you could be anywhere. I LOVE sitting here watching the world pass me by, and it's really good to come and get some work done without the distraction of the internet. Well, the internet is available here but at a ridiculous price. Starbucks coffee is the same worldwide, but this particular Starbucks has something that none of the others have - anonymity!Meh.....

I've found a better Starbucks just 5 minutes down the street!! It's much quieter and much nicer.
This branch is always busy, the tourists are always needing their caffine rush and the queue is always MASSIVE.Oh Greggs. I owe you one.

I've lost count of the amount of times this place has sorted me out. It's hangover food essentially, but damn good hangover food!! They have brilliant sandwiches that are all made fresh daily, and their cakes are yummy. Their sausage rolls are what save my life.

This place is almost always full of students, looking for their fix. It's always busy, and the staff are lovely. You can't really go wrong with Greggs.I've been here a few times with the extended family and friends. I think we always choose Bar Roma because it is very family-friendly and have a quick and easy menu. The food comes out within 15-20 minutes and is really tasty - if maybe a tiny bitty bland. I always have spaghetti Carbonara here and it is one of the better ones. Whenever I order carbonara I always leave about half of it on my plate, but they have the perfect balance here.

The staff are great too, the kids always love them and they have a great sense of humour. Overall, it's a brilliant place to go with big groups and families!Ahhhh cakes and pastries........how I love thee!!

This place looks fabulous and smells even better!! Taste however, leaves a bit to be desired. On the two occassions I've been here I think I made the wrong choice, as the cakes I had were stale and not very nice. My friends loved their choices though.

Don't have a cupcake when you come here, choose something a bit more exciting - learn from my mistakes!I like to come here before hitting one the big clubs on George street. It's nice to have somewhere relatively cheap to sit with friends and have fun!
The bar is really nice, lovely trendy decor. It's a bit small, and I'm always aware of being underground. The bar can get a bit busy, but beig a victim of its own success shouldn't put you off! 
It's a great place to come before a nigh out, it's in a good location for Edinburgh's hotspots and can be quite cheap!Located in the heart of student-ridden George-Square area, Snax is the ideal solution for the main problem in the area = hungry students. They have cheap food, cheap drinks and cheap humour.
They make great breakfast rolls, as my fellow yelpers has said, and will save your life when in need.
Although they are not open at the weekend, mid-week mornings here are always busy to make sure you go reasonably early to be able to get the greasy goodness!As with a previous yelper, I was attracted to the Malt Shovel because of their beautiful hanging-baskets outside. Yeah, I realize that sounds a bit uncool for a 20 year old, but I was with my mum and she likes those sorts of things. 

The pub was what you would expect from an Edinburgh/British pub. Very pleasant, very nice atmosphere and lovely staff, but pretty average to be honest. Their wine was quite warm - Heinous crime in my opinion - and they didn't have any Pimms so I wasn't all that satisfied with the overall experience. But it was nice to sit outside and watch the world go by (not that much of the world passes Cockburn Street).I grew up in a small town called Buckie, in the north east of Scotland. Not much happened there, but about 10 minutes down the road in a town called Fochabers, Baxters was born. The original village (because it is a village, there's no other way of describing it) was built here to celebrate all things Baxters. So when I saw the shop in Ocean Terminal, I had to pay it a visit!
Baxters has got a good reputation for its soup and for celebrating everything Scottish. What most people don't know, is that up north it is famous for their Pancakes - they could make a grown man weep.  I was disappointed when I saw they didn't make them here, but it's a good shop nevertheless. This branch is more for condiments and soups than homebakes and lunches, so I felt a but let down in that respect, but Baxters produces such high quality stuff, it only took a tin of Cullen Skink to forgive.Meh, this place is ok.

It's pretty standard to be honest, the same baguettes, the same presentation and the same prices. it's not anything special.

If anything, the bread was a bit tough to eat and cut my gums. 

It's ok...Chocolate soup?! Whatever will they think of next?! 

I was intrigued with this place so accompanied a friend for lunch. It wasn't the nicest of places....sortof canteen-like and a little bit dirty. The white tables and white plastic chairs wern't very attractive....and the tables needed a good clean!!

I'm planning on giving Chocolate Soup a second chance, because all my friends rave about it . Watch this spaceWhen I was younger visiting Edinburgh, I would drive my mum and dad CRAZY because I would insist that we go to Daniels for dinner. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Whenever we went I always had a mushroom crepe and ice cream. Seperately, of course. The other day my mum and I decided we would go back, y'know, to see if it had changed. It was better!

It is a lot nicer than I remembered - but I suppose a 10year old doesn't really notice the decor. They have a really brilliant bar and really lovely artwork throughout.

They describe their menu as a 'Scottish-Franco love affair' - I don't know what that's about but I certainly was having a sordid love affair with the Fish casserole. I nearly died when I saw they still had the mushroom crepe, just as tasty as  I remembered - and I don't even like mushrooms!!

I thoroughly recommend Daniel's Bistro. It is in Leith, so not quite the city centre but it makes for a lovely area to walk off the delicious food you've just eaten!I don't like this place. Purely because an ex of mine works here, a particularly shitty ex. 

You might like it though...!!

It's above average as a bar and restaurant. Every Tuesday they have great  free food giveaways for students. It's amazing, too good to be true! Every now and again the huge Frankenstein face thing comes down from the ceiling, pretty f'ing scary if you're not expecting it!
They have pizza's, burgers, salads and lots of other options.

It's a fun place, definitely worth a look in.The Apex looks great from the outside - big, modern and trendy. The inside is similar too...aside from the big comments. I found the rooms quite small, and was disappointed in the bathroom.

The rooms are nice enough - I was reminded that we wern't in the hotel for the rooms, we were there to visit the city so I suppose it's all that we needed. It's in a great location and every now and then they have really cheap deals. If it's your first time in Edinburgh then this would be the ideal hotel to stay in, for all the tourist-y things, but there are nicer hotels in the city for your second visit.You can't really miss the Balmoral. It's one of those landmarks in Edinburgh that gives the city it's posh name - it just looks fancy and expensive. The best thing about The Balmoral, in my opinion, are all the door-men waiting to open your car door for you, to welcome you in - ahh! I suddenly feel like I've gone up a tax-bracket.

The staff are lovely (especially Thea) and the service is top-notch. And it's the playground for celebs when they come to the city, I've seen the likes of Graeme Norton, Robbie coltrane, Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber and Louis Walsh  - to name but a few

Oh, I'll get those names for you...I seem to have dropped them...

Overall it's a really lovely place to represent the city. It's for those who want to splurge, but it's worth spoiling yourself once in a while, right?I've been to a few Peckhams in Edinburgh, but none feel as classy as this Stockbridge branch. It lures you in! On a warm day there are always people sitting outside and it is always busy.

I quite fancy myself as a viticulturist, and the selection of wine here is amazing. I didn't even recognise the majority of the bottles and names, and I think it showed on my face as I was helped within 3 minutes of coming in. The staff were lovely and really happy to helped, and they knew what they were talking about.

I then had a cake and sat outside watching the world pass me by. Their selection is great and quite reasonable for the size you get! It is a bit pricey, however, but it's Peckhams!I study Geography at Edinburgh Uni, and so Brass Monkey is somewhat of a local of mine. After every deadline and exam, my friend and I totter up to Monkeys and sit all afternoon long.
It's a really cool pub, really relaxed and really nice to be in. They show movies all day and it's the sort of place you want to take your mum. It can get a bit crazy when it's busy, but on a nice afternoon there's nowhere I'd rather be for my G&T fixOk so maybe not so great this time round but still very good!!

It's got a great atmosphere, it's really happy and a good place to be!! Lots of positive energy and lots of happy faces.

The food wasn't as good as last time, but hey!I's still a good place to be!UHOH!!

I was going to give this little midnight feast a good review, until I read the papers a few weeks ago. They were closed for being 'horrifically unhygienic' , having the 'lowest standards ever seen by an inspector' and  people were surprised 'nobody had died from eating here' . If that's a reason not go to, I don't know what is.

However, if it's 2am and you're desperate for food, Bar Napoli is your place....as soon as it re-opensI'm a bit of a spice pussy, so a korma will do me nicely thank you. But this korma is really good!! You can just tell it's going straight to your hips though, it's too creamy to be good for you.
My dad had a somewhat adventurous Bhuna, and loved it. He said the meat was cooked well (which is a surprise ) and the sauce was really tasty. 
All in all it was a good experience!! However the price was a but hefty, albeit with a bottle of wine!! It was a good experience though.I used to come her practically every day of the week when I worked for the festival last august. As it was open till 5am during the fringe, it made for a great haunt! But to be honest, one of the only reasons we went was because of the late opening hours!

Although it is a jazz piano bar, there isn't much jazzy about it. It's an old-looking place that could do with a make-over. The floor and tables are sticky and it's quite messy. 

Saying that, however, when there is a pianist there is an electric atmosphere. It's briliant fun and is one of the best places to be in the city!

So, following this quite inconclusive and contradictory review, i'd say give it a go, it's a hit or a miss with fingersIf you could epitomize the perfect hotel, this would be it. As soon as you walk in here you are met by a lovely concierge and receptionist, marble floors and really elegant seating areas.

they have a brilliant restaurant here too - ok I wouldn't exactly go out of my way to come here for dinner, but as a hotel restaurant it is a total gem. They have brilliant breakfasts too.

The rooms are lovely too, really big and again follow the elegant theme. They are just right, and the location of the hotel is brilliant. It is far enough away from the city centre to be quiet yet close enough to be there (on foot) within ten minutes! When you step outside this hotel you are met with the best scenery in the city - Arthurs seat is directly opposite, the Parliament is to your left and the wonderful Royal Mile is behind you. Perfect!

If you're coming to the city, this is definitely where you should stay.I had heard good things about this place, but  wasn't overly impressed. The service wasn't very good, I was treated like a sheep in the market and rushed along the line, paid little attention and i don't think anyone behind the counter ever cracked a smile. What happened to service with a smile?
My sandwich wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The first few bits were tasty but not so much by the end of it....but not a bad experience!!I had heard good things about this place before I managed to go to it. My best friend would come to Edinburgh regularly for the rugby and would rave about the mussels in this restaurant. So I checked it out!

The atmosphere is really laid back and really comfortable. It's the sort of place you don't need to get really dressed up for, go in wearing a hoody and fat-ants and you're just fine.
You have to have mussels when you're here, they're really yummy!It's big, it's in your face and it's very garish. You can't miss it.....kinda wish I did.

I came here in my first year as my friends and I were looking for somewhere to get our fried-rice-fix. Dragon Way fell into our lap and it wasn't the nicest of experiences. Bleugh.

The staff were overly attentive and pounced on us if we so much as made eye contact with them. It wasn't a good atmosphere and I won't be back!Being somewhat of a wine-connoisseur myself...HA!

I don't know too much about wine, but I know that you can make any glass of white ten times better by serving it chilled. Extra chillen. And Ecco Vino delivers. It's a great little wine bar just off the Royal Mile, and is my guilty pleasure on my way home from a hard days shopping. It's got a really comfortable atmosphere, and nothing about it feels pretentious, which is rare for Edinburgh. Their food is yummy too, I shared a small starter with my mum to line my stomach before a bottle of Sincere (cold, I might add) and desperately want to go back for a full meal.

Thoroughly recommend Ecco Vino!From the outside, this place looks really modern and welcoming. But it's somewhat aged on the inside! I was so surprised when I came in - the huge glass front always made it look so cool. Glass has a tendency of doing that!
Don't get me wrong, it's not bad inside the theatre  -  far from it - but I suppose I was expecting leather recliners and cupholders. It's not a cinema, Emily.

They always attract great plays and shows too. I came to see Peter Pan here once and it was brilliant! They do have a niche market sometimes though, things like Stomp and Bach concerto's are common. If you're into that then great! But I'm more of a tinkerbell kinda galI totally agree with everything that;s been said before me. It just reeks cool, and it's sort of a place to be seen but to push aside mainstream George Street bars.
Make sure you're looking cool when you're in here, maybe come here after a hair-cut or after a few cocktails!!

It's a really nice place to be in general. I love sitting here no matter the weather, it's a nice experience with a lovely atmosphere!this is one of the most amazing Starbucks I've ever been in - and I've been in a few.

You would never really notice it unless you were looking for it - so look up. The view is amazing, it's second to none in the city. The staff are good too!Amicus Apple is one of those places in Edinburgh that you feel and look trendy when you are in there. I feel particularly cool sitting in the white pods outside watching the world go by. It's not a big bar, but it has a bite.

The bar/restaurant prides itself on it's extensive cocktail menu, and they are delicious. There is always a slightly sour after-taste, however, when you hand over your card and discover that the earth-shattering cocktail cost you £9. Ouch.

But, all is not lost. Their wine is always really lovely and chilled and served in nice big glasses. And their food is really tasty! I recommend their saints and sinners menu, it's a great tapas menu with a quirky twist. 
I was disappointed in their Cullen Skink (seafood chowder, but better) though. I grew up 5 minutes from Cullen so I was really excited when I saw it on the menu, but it was really salty. My mum loved it though, and it fills you up all day. They also have a good pasta of the day too, it's always really good.

So, it's a really good place to visit for lunch. On Sundays you can sit around and play board-games and chillax, but don't order a cocktail. Tap water, please.I think it deserves an extra star, don't you? I've come to love Amicus Apple. The staff are lovely - especially Emma. The food is good - especially the baked camambert, and the drinks are great - especially the cocktails. 
It's a lovely cosy bar, it's small enough to be intimate yet big enough to be roomy. 

During the festival they have a great little beer garden with red and white bubble chairs that you can get so easily lost in. It's slowly becoming one of my favourite places in the city!Poor Liquid Rooms!!

It was set on fire last year, and when I heard the news I was devastated. It was one of my favourite clubs in Edinburgh because they played brilliant music, it was never too busy and you could always get served at one of the two bars. However, when the fire shut it down for several months, I didn't think it would survive.

...but it's back!! Having it's grand re-opening this week, Liquid Rooms is all set to return to its former glory. And I can't wait!! As I said, it is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh and I know it will come back with a vengeance. Watch this space!I always laugh when I come to All Bar One - it's the ONLY place my mum ever wants to go to in Edinburgh and it's the ONLY place we ever do go to! But hey, if it ain't broke....!!

My ex-boss just started here as the manager - Mel (hiya!) - and she has told me it's the most stressful job she's ever had. I can tell - it's always busy. Whenever we come for lunch we either have to wait or pounce on a table that look ready to leave. The lay-out is really quite crammed, but in a busy place like all Bar One it has to be.

The food is really good  - they have  great tapas menu (and I can thoroughly recommend the baked camambert...mmmm) and a good main-menu. One of their kebabs is more than enough for one person - don't make the mistake we did!

AND you get m&m's with your bill. YASS!!I'm really glad to learn that I wasn't the only one to get ID'd every other minute! And I look old for my age (a modest 20, or twenteen as I prefer it) so I never, ever get asked to prove it. Maybe they were trying to flatter me.

Anyway, the pub itself, as has been mentioned is more of a novelty than particularly chic. Well that depends on your definition of chic I suppose. If novelty book cases and murder-mystery style is chic to you, then grab your glad-rags.

The prices are good too, and it's in a good location so you can come here before a night on the town and barely have to bear the walk!I think The Rutland gets a bad name because it was featured in Trainspotting. You know the scene where the guy throws a bottle down into a bar and he starts a huge fight? yeah, that's The Rutland. It's unfair that it's associated with this though, because it's such a damn cool place!!

As the Yelpers have said before me, it oozes cool and belongs on George Street. The decor is brilliant and the staff are really friendly. I agree with Amy in that the food isn't the best, but this is the sort of place you go to people watch and sip cocktails I suppose. I wouldn't choose to eat here, but would most definitely choose to drink here.

Don't mention Trainspotting though, it's like salt to an open wound...If you like seafood, good seafood, then you HAVE to come to Fishers. It's absolutely amazing!! I never knew fish could taste so so good.

Their menu is really good (if maybe a bit small, but that suits me fine) and they always have some specials. I must say though - if you go here on this recommendation then you have to have the mussels too. They have a smaller starter portion and a large main, but to be honest the starter is more than enough! I was too full for my halibut after the mussels.
If you're a mussels fan - or even if you're not - try these mussels. D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!!!!!!

They always have a meat option too if you don't fancy fish.

The bad thing about Fishers is the toilets...or lack thereof! They need more than one!!You can't really fault this place for location. It's secondary to none, and is the basis of my 4* review!
As a tourist this is probably the best place to stay in the city. It's right in the middle of Princes Street and has brilliant views of the castle and the city gardens.
The hotel itself doesn't look like much, but don't judge a book by its cover. Up some stairs (or elevator, whatever) and you are in the Waverly! It's nice enough, really traditional and still has a Scottish twist. 
As highlighted before me, the prices are brilliant too. So overall, for your value for money and location, you can't really go wrong!Edinburgh's Royal Mile is probably the most famous street in the city, so it's only natural to find nice wee Scottish pubs lining it. The Mitre is a fine example of one, a traditional Scottish pub that always has live folk music. I play the violin (or fiddle, if you prefer) so I appreciate a good folk-band and there is always great ones in the Mitre. It's alluring to walk past this bar and see the musicians and hear the atmosphere - indeed, that is how I came across it - it's definitely worth a visit.
The music is normally in the evening, so if you're walking around the city drop in, you won't be disappointed.
As with all bars on the Royal Mile, however, it's quite pricey. But good for the odd drinkIf there's one thing I can say about Browns it is this - reliable. It was one of the few places on George Street that didn't take reservations (although it has just started to) so you can walk in whenever you like and get a table. I recently came here after a long drive, at 9.30pm thinking the kitchen would be closed (as it was a Tuesday night) but I was greeted with great enthusiasm and invited to look at the menu within minutes of arriving. I asked for the fish of the day - a fish pie, which was delicious. I was even given a poached egg following a conversation with the waiter - it's the small things! The fish pie came with tempura prawns as the chef decided he wanted to play around with the dish, which I loved.

Their cocktails are really nice too, a bit pricey, but good. Their menu is really extensive and they do a brilliant brunch which I highly recommend. Again, there can only be one word for Browns - reliable.I came here once on a date (a rather awkward one at that) and thought the Spanish decor and warm atmosphere would put me at ease. But it didn't! The restaurant itself has been decorated in true traditional Spanish style and looks amazing when you first walk in. We were shown to our seat  - a lovely one in the window -  but our table was messy and there was food everywhere. I found this odd, as there were only 3 other tables in at the time, they wern't exactly busy.
We ordered a selection of tapas and was impressed at how quickly it came, but sadly I wasn't impressed by the food. To me, Tapas is really exciting and full of flavour, but the dishes we had were boring and really rather plain. I got the impression it had some straight from the freezer.

As a franchise it's a nice addition, the location is great and the staff are friendly. Didn't leave me singing la vida loca, however.I had heard brilliant things before I came her, so was expecting the most amazing experience ever. My experience.....meh!

It's in a great location, you can't deny it. I was really impressed on the way up, I had no idea it was here! It's lovely inside and is really impressive to look at....but meh.

The menu was really impressive, drizzled in this and sautéed in that, .....meh!!

The price was through the roof as expected. Staff were really friendly and OTT. Overall it's a lovely place and good food....but mehI'm sorry, I don't get it. I really, really don't get it.

This place is a haven for rugby lads, Stag doo's, hen parties and general drunken louts (myself included). Thus, it really isn't anything special! That's the thing, I don't realise why I always end up here!

'Let's go to spoons!'

'The order is in order!'

'All stand!'

these are just some examples of the things you over-hear on a night out. It draws in the crowds! But it's skanky, dirty and smelly. It sort of has a childish charm about it. The food is pretty rough too - greasy pub food. And drinks are surprisingly expensive!

Despite all this, as I say it always attracts the crowds! But don't expect anything special!There are lots of restaurants in Edinburgh on a similar vibe as the Filling Station, and to be perfectly honest, they are all better. 
It's a huge place and the memorabilia fills every inch of the walls. It's a nice enough place - clean and tidy, I mean - and the staff are nice. But it doesn't quite make up for what you get. The food can be quite greasy and I wouldn't trust the meat, to be perfectly honest.

Yeah it's ok, but  I would never go out of my way to come here. But if I was stuck for somewhere to go and happened to be in the area I would pop in. it's not all that bad.There are few places in Edinburgh that I'll travel to, but this place is something special. The cure yellow themes and old-fashioned decorations has to be seen to be believed.

I always come here with my mum to have a hot chocolate and carrot cake....it's to DIE for!! The presentation of their cakes is amazing, they put their heart and soul into making sure everything is just right.
The cafe itself is really lovely and quaint. They sometimes have live music, which is wonderful to sit and listen to - i feel like I'm in sex and the city sometimes.

The best thing of all is it's really cheap! Bargain! This place is really specialI used to love coming here with my mum for a cocktail before going into George St for dinner, but the last few times I've been have left me a bit disappointed. It was once really busy with a great atmosphere, and really quite cool! The dark brown theme made it seem mysterious and trendy, but my last few visits found the dark brown theme seem dirty and almost shabby. The staff are really friendly and make an effort to welcome you and serve you but again I feel it has gone a bit downhill. The cocktails are really good though, but pricey.
Maybe all it needs is a new lick of paint or an update. This used to be one of my favourite bars in Edinburgh, so I really hope it gets its act together so I can be a regular once again!I once heard that Jimmy Chungs in Elgin got shut down for serving Seagull meat. I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that Jimmy Chings in Elgin was shut for about 3 weeks mysteriously. Do do dooo do doooo.....

So I'm always a bit apprehensive of this Chinese chain, following the Elgin story. However I came here recently and was quite surprised at how good the selection was and how tasty it was. I must admit, I avoided the meat unless I was totally sure what it was. It's your bog-standard Chinese, although this one does have an outside area, which I imagine is quite nice in the summer!
It's all reasonably prices too, they always have big banners outside advertising cheap prices etc. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet, so value for money is amazing.What a lovely place! It's in a great location and has lovely views of Leith and the canal.   A few of my mums friends have told me to come to this place for yelp, and I'm annoyed it took  me so long to come here! It's got a great reputation amongst locals, which is always a sign of a good restaurant.

The staff are lovely, they really want you to have a good time and they are at your beck and call.

The atmosphere is cosy, really pleasant and what you'd expect from  a busy restaurant. The food is lovely too, everything is mouth watering and reasonable!

All in all, a wonderful experience!I really like the Living Room, despite the fact it's mainly aimed for the elite in the city. I like it because when you walk in there's a warm atmosphere and a piano playing in the background. I like it because you are led through the restaurant and all the sexy leather booths to your table with every eye in the joint following you. I like it!

The best thing about this restaurant is the food. My mum comes here regularly and she always says it's a hit or a miss, but I always get a hit. I've never had a bad experience here but I am aware that a lot of people do, so keep that in mind.

There is always a good deal on the internet to dine in The Living Room, 2 for 1 and 30% discounts etc. It's worth going if the deal is good enough, I like it!I agree with Amy G, this place is rubbish!!

My brothers excitedly told me to go here whenever I am on my way home from a night out because when they had been here they had met Party Boy from Jackass. Yeah ok. When I did eventually make it there, it was grotty, small and full of people just watching me. What's up with that? I was with my friend after a night out and we both ordered Chicken Pakora and were going to sit in and eat it,but upon seeing all the boxes of half-eaten food and drunks lolling around beside it, we decided against it. The food was horrible, really chewy and had no taste. We wern't impressed, and even less so when we went back another time for chips - how can you get chips wrong?! Maybe we should have tried the Pizza - it is their speciality.....but i dread to think....Everything in here is pretty standard....typical American style, typical music-memorabilia, typical HUGE portions etc etc. I came here once having a hankering for a hamburger, but I found the layers and layers of meat, lettuce, cheese, bacon and bread too much to handle. I ordered the BBQ Burger but I couldn't eat half of it. The chips too, were all left on my plate. 
Ok, I admit it probably has something to do with the fact that I had cheese and coriander quesadilla to share with my friends to start with, but I only had 2 slices, and I was starving. I must admit though  - the quesadilla was delicious.
The burger...not so much. As I was munching my way through I kept thinking about my mum - if there was something that wasn't particularly tasty she would say to me 'it's not worth the calories Em!' , and she was right. 
Overall I wasn't impressed with my burger, but the quesadilla was amazing. The entire time I was there, more and more people came in (particularly, and somewhat ironically, mostly American tourists) and all ordered ribs and wings. 
To be honest I found it difficult to have a conversation with my friends whilst in Hard Rock because the music was blaring, but the decor was quite cool and the seats were comfy!I'm going to keep this simple - if you're in Edinburgh and done all the touristy stuff and looking for that 'oh wow'....the x factor.....that something special, then make your way to Calton Hill and get involved in the Nelson Monument. I can't really say much more as it's all been said before me...but wow. just wow.This place has to be amongst my favourites in Edinburgh, purely because it's just so random!! It's a ski bar, essentially. It's the sort of place I would fully expect to find in a French ski resort, and it has the same atmosphere - fun!! The wooden interior and ski memrobellia make it one of the cooler places to be in Edinburgh. 
The best thing is it has amazing cocktails .... Who knew! The raspberry mojoto in particular is a killer. I don't think they measure their alcohol legally, they are so so strong. 
They have quite a small dancefloor too, so you can boogie on down till the wee hours. During the festival it's open till 5, like most of the clubs. 
My favourite thing about garibaldis is the reaction of my friends when I bring them here. You totally wouldn't expect it to be in Edinburgh!

Although I must admit the entrance fee is a bit hefty - I think it was around £8 each. But of you can look past that then it's billiant!EUGH!!

This place was hyped up to me as being the most fun I'll ever have on a Sunday night in Edinburgh. I was lied to. This place is awful...the worst club I've been in in Edinburgh. The place, the people, the music, it's all horrendous. This is the sort of place that the local school-kids borrow their brothers' and sisters' IDs for. It's a glorified school disco.....scrap that, they have regular school discos here too. They sometimes play host to foam parties too. I was once in the queue and had the pleasure of watching girls in bikini's on stilts juggling with fire. I still don't get it.

If you're a lad looking for a place to go on the pull or get wasted, go to Cav. But if you have a shread of self-respect, go elsewhere. It's not worth it.I've always walked past this quaint restaurant and noticed it's always busy! Plus they have a really cute smart car that scoots around the city with the license plate 'T4 PAS' so I was intrigued.

Barioja is a really warm, welcoming place that has a great atmosphere. The Spanish way of life is very welcoming and family-orientated, and is captured really well in this restaurant. The menu was ridiculously big! It took me about 30 minutes to look through everything, as I wanted to make sure I chose the right things. There were 4 of us and we had 10 tapas dishes, which was way too much. Everything was really good though  - especially the fish dishes and the mustard-chicken. 
The best thing about this restaurant is that not many people know about it. Locals to Edinburgh always come here, which always says quality.I was dragged here once by my 57 year old auntie who was looking to pull. I think that sums it up! Jools Holland owns it- which gives it some credit I suppose, and it's nicely decorated inside but it's not my cup of tea. It seemed to be a playground for the over 50s looking to re-live their youth. It reminded me of dad dancing at a wedding - you know the sort. On several occasions, sweaty old men made their move towards me, at which point I hastily circled the room.
Food-wise, it wasn't anything special either. I had pan-fried chicken without realizing it doesn't come with anything else, should have ordered sides. Yeah it was ok, and the price wasn't too bad, but nothing worth going out my way for.I love going here at Christmas time  - not because they do an especially good job at decorating the place, but there always seems to be a Christmas-jumper party when I'm there. It's the sort of place you would go on your staff night out - it's really nice! I was put off at first as it doesn't look like much from the outside; you have to go down some stairs and under a canopy to get in, but I was very impressed with the interior. It's your typical Edinburgh trendy bar/restaurant, cool wallpaper and nice furniture.  As a result all the people are ridiculously cool and the place is heaving with MILFs and DILFs. It is the sort of place to take your mum out for a (liquid) lunch and spend the afternoon people-watching.Some of my fondest memories of being a student in edinburgh revove around these galleries. When I was a young sprog in 1st and 2nd year, my outside subject was history of art. Every week we would have to meet in small groups and discuss the art as well as present on it in the gallery. As my class was 10am, we would all meet outside the gallery at 9.30 and sat in the sun. Bliss!

These galleries are brilliant. They have amazing exhibitions, such as andy Warhol, Monet, Manet and much more. As well visiting artists they have a really strong collection. If you're into art at all then I thoroughly recommend these galleries.  
If you don't fancy paying to get in, the gallery at the back is free. Top tip!This place has such a big reputation which  I didn't even know about!! Tourists lap this sh*t up!

It's pretty standard, tourists listen up - you'll love it in here. It just sounds Scottish doesn't it? Deacon Brodies, aye make mine a whiskey!!

The atmosphere is good, the food is average and the drinks are reasonable, so all in all not bad!Oloroso is one of those places in Edinburgh that I would only tell my best friends about. If you walked past it on the street you wouldn't look twice, but going up in the elevator and reaching the roof-top terrace still gives me butterflies. My family only go to Oloroso for special occassions, it's a tradition for my brothers and I to go there on the day of our graduation, so it's only reserved for special ocassions. The lay-out is really quite chic, the grey-and-yellow colour scheme inspired my brother to do the same in his bedroom, which, annoyingly, is really cool. It's really special and the terrace is in the perfect position to get great photos with the castle in the background.

However, I have been for a drink in Oloroso and found the whole experience entirely different. The bar staff are quite arrogant (but extremely handsome, so probably quite right to be) and shaking a cocktail is as much about the performance as the drinking. And it's really pricey, not the place to go to for a quick drink and catch up with a friend.Best. Crepes. Ever. FACT.

If you need a reason to go to Le Sept, there it is. The crepes. 

The food is really good too, it's French (oorrghh orrghhh oorrghh - say it in a french accent) and so you know it's going to be good.

It's lovely inside too, has a brilliant atmosphere and the staff are always really happy to help.

I really want a crepe now.Lenny Henry, you lied to me! I didn't have the best nights sleep I would ever have and I didn't have peace and quiet!

Saying that, it's a Travelodge. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's a good price and the quality for money is brilliant! This particular Travelodge is good because of the location - it's far enough away from the city centre to be relatively quiet at night but is close enough to walk home from a night out. 

I didn't have the best experience here I must admit, but it's because I stayed here during the festival and was woken every hour by people stumbling home. It is really good though, and they always have really good deals on.
If you're coming to edinburgh on a relatively low budget - this is your place!I came here on a Saturday night after an orchestra concert (I know, geeky huh) and thought I would feel a but out of place....seeing as I was wearing a black ball-gown n all. However a combination of the really dim lighting and the fact that it was too busy to see my feet meant that nobody really noticed. It was a weekend, yeah, but it was packed to the brim It's not the biggest of places at the best of times. 
I found it was full of the older gentlemen who were on the prowl, and thus I didn't hang around for long. Plus the wine was warm and it was £6 for a large. PAH!
I went back on a Friday at 7ish and it was far better. It's a cool place!'Emily, you HAVE to go to Ping on, it's like, amazing, yah yah yah' were the words I heard walking a rather tiddly and posh friend back home to Stockbridge the other night. I had heard about it, as it is open very late and feeds the drunk 2am market. What's not to like?

Well, I made the mistake of eating here sober. Don't get me wrong - it was edible, but only just. I had crispy beef and my friend had sweet and sour chicken, but they both tasted exactly the same. The rice was really cold too, which I'm always wary of following a less-than-pleasant experience in Tenerife with bad rice.

The shop itself is quite cool in it's own way...maybe unintentionally so but cool nevertheless. I think that going here after a night out is the best way to experience PingOn, inebriating the senses.As Marj said, the size of the place is what hits you first! It's huge!! It's also one of my preferred places to eat - which is rare for the royal mile.

For one, it's not aimed at tourists. It's just a nice place to eat, a nice normal casual could-be-anywhere-in-the-world place to eat....unlike all those tartan clad, william wallace-loving places all around it.

they have a really good menu which I've yet to work through. It's all reasonably priced too, and has a brilliant atmosphere. The name of the place gives it away - always chilled , always happy, always Sunday!I live in Holyrood, so imagine my surprise when I found out there was a museum a mere 2 minutes from my flat. Who knew! So off I went with my friend Lauren, hoping for a nice, educational day out.
....it wasn't so great though. It's really small and doesn't really have much to offer, to be brutally honest. Yeah it's free - but it would have to be. I wouldn't pay to get in there!
Maybe it's worth a look if you've exhausted all other things to do in the city, but otherwise walk on by!There are only a few places in Edinburgh that I would recommend to a stranger in the street, but Bene's is numero uno, in my opinion. Yeah, ok, it's a fish and chip shop. But what's wrong with that?! I've eaten in fancy restaurants and paid through my ears for an average-tasting fish, but Bene's guarantees quality every single time. Fish and chips is, somewhat sadly, a trademark meal in the UK, so for tourists wanting to experience the best it has to be Bene's.

The fish and chips are to die for, you just know it's good quality fish. I've lost count of the amount of nights out that have ended up in a visit to Bene's (open till 2am at the weekends). The staff are LOVELY. I would be embarrassed that my local chippy knows me on a first-name basis, but I am thoroughly pleased to be able to chat to Maria and her husband Carlo, and even Bene when he is around. They are lovely, genuine people who work very hard. 
As well as your standard fish and chips, I can thoroughly reccommend the mince pies, cheese-burgers and pizzas (which they make with haggis!). It's real, honest, comfort food that is the highlight of my month! 

Furthermore, it is a widely known fact that whenever royalty comes to Edinburgh, they get a Bene's fish and chips. If it's good enough for the Queen, it's good enough for me.Ahh Bene's - now you deliver!!!

I was informed a few days ago that my mum had bought a new flat in the city and thus I was moving to it....but it's about 20 minutes from Bene's. Seriously, this upset me a bit. I've been so used to nipping up to Bene's for a pint of milk or some dinner, I've taken it for granted. Just when I thought all hope was lost, Maria informed me that they delivery. Thank you God.

Now you have no excuse not to try on of their famous dishes, they deliver!!!! woohooo!!This wee coffee shop is always busy! They always have posters up on the walls advertising the next gig or concert in Edinburgh's ally's. Because of this, I always think it's pretty cool!

They don't have many places to sit other than a couple stools at the window, which are almost always occupied. But it doesn't really matter, you can get your food/coffee and eat en route or find a nice seat somewhere - I personally go down to Dynamic Earth and use their picnic benches.
Their food menu isn't substantial but is good nevertheless. It's relatively cheap and can give you a student discount if you ask nicely.

I really like this place as it is en route to my classes and is cheaper than the bigger chains. Their coffee is hot though, so if you're not a heat-freak, like me, then leave it to cool down for a while. Your tongue will thank you for it.It speaks volumes for a place by how busy it is, and Cafe Rouge is always very busy. You have to book - there's no question about that. But it's a brilliant place.
Their food is delicious, I especially love their steak sandwiches (they do a male and female version) and their smoked salmon salad. 
The only thing I would say is their coke is served in TINY glasses, I had to ask for 3 top-ups. The table comes with a jug of water though, so it's not a big problem.

The service is brilliant too - when my cousin still hadn't arrived they took away his pre-ordered steak and chips and kept it on heat for him, providing fresh chips. It's the little touches eh!I'm not the biggest fan of Harry's Bar. For one thing, I always found their logo quite crude. You can see his willy! And for another thing, it's just not very good quality.

I was lured in, as I imagine most people would be, by the cool neon lights and the name - Harry's Bar sounds pretty trendy, right? If it's good enough for Harry, then it's good enough for Emily.

Their cocktail menu looks amazing - but don't be lured in. I ordered a Pina Colada (one of my favourites, along with long walks in the rain) but it was so heavy and sweet I could barely drink half!
Furthermore, I found the whole experience quite grotty, the bar wasn't clean and there were a lot of empty glasses around.

I'll have to come back for food and let you know...We all remember this place from Gordon Ramsay's programme, right? But do you also remember that it didn't win? No? Well it didn't. Lets just remind ouselves of that.

It's obviously done very well for itself following the TV debut, and people are flocking to this place to try this amazing chinese food. Yeah it's really delicious, but I worry that it's becoming a victim of its own success. It has put the prices up and the food is becoming a bit dull to be honest.

The dumplings are amazing though - you can't deny that. Simply delicious!!

If the prices were  a bit lower and maybe a special every week, it would get itself out of the lul its found itself in.The Tass is a nice pub on the Royal Mile paying homage to good ole Rabbie Burns. As such the pub has a selection of memorabilia on the walls which is quite nice to see.

the bar itself is quite nice, it has a good traditional atmosphere and looks nice. Every night they have live folk music, which always attracts a crowd.  
the food isn't anything special, but what you'd expect from a pub. It's a nice place to spend a Sunday evening in a hoody!I came here with my brother during Christmas time, and it just gave me butterflies to walk in! The decorations were fantastic and the whole atmosphere was electric. You could have been anywhere in the world!

The whole place is really cool, it's designed well and it's easy to maneuver around. The food is good too - pretty standard really. I had chicken noodles in sweet chilli and my brother had chicken with leeks. He loved it, and so did I -albeit a little bit spicy. We had a bottle of red wine with our meal, and my chocolate brownie was the best I've ever tasted!! It all came to a grand total of £22 - we nearly choked! Turns out there was a 2 for 1 deal we had inadvertently signed up for. 

It's a lovely place and I've been back several times since and never been disappointed!Sitting snugly just off George st, le sandwich is a great little place if you need a bite to eat. They have a great selection of sandwiches and home-bakes (the empire biscuits are my favourite) and really good salad boxes. They have home-made soup every day too, but I didn't enjoy the carrot&corriander when I had it - but then that's my own fault because I don't like carrots. 
Everything is freshly prepared and made infront of you. 
It's really cheap too, you cab get a bacon roll and a coffee for £2.40. Bargain!

Don't walk past it, go on in!Yeah it;s lovely here. Yeah it's idyillic. But I used to come here every other week with my boyfriend, who cheated on me (scumbag), so I don't like these gardens so much.

I know it's not their fault, but it's full of memories for me. But I suppose that's a testament to how brilliant the Botanic Gardens are  - they are really lovely and you can easily spend a whole day in here.

I hope I can take my next boyfriend here and make new memories, because I don't want to lose the gardens!The Mocha's are good

The sandwiches are tasty

The staff are friendly

The price is ridiculousIf you're a student and it's a nice day, you will find yourself in The Pear Tree. 

I associate the Pear Tree with great memories. After almost every exam I've ever sat I come here with friends and sit outside, no matter what weather, and have cider. Bliss!!

Their outdoor seating area is brilliant, there are about 12 or 15 picnic benches and nice plants! It's always busy on a sunny day, so make sure you come nice and early.
The drinks are a bit expensive though, if I can remember (because I tend to get tipsy) then the cider was around £3, maybe a little more. 
The inside is a typical Scottish pub - horrible carpet and leather stools. But I kinda love that!I was a bit nervous of Creelers when I first went for dinner - it had been recommended to me by my mother following a 'lovely' date, and as such I didn't know whether to expect something really traditional (mum's favourites) or something really trendy (mum likes to think she's trendy). Turns out it was a perfect combination of the two.

The restaurant atmosphere was very warm and very welcoming, although it was a bitty too quiet for my liking. The staff were super attentive and were really lovely...if anything, they were too nice, but could be due to the fact that they had nobody else to see to.

Overall, however, I was shocked by the prices - tres expensivo. The main courses were all about £18. Unfortunately, unlike my mum I wasn't on a date and so therefore I had to pay for my own (grudgingly)  and really felt the pinch. However, the food was delicious. I had smoked haddock with scallops and mussels in a creamy garlic sauce and can highly recommend it. Annoyingly you have to order sides with every course, but it is super yummy. 

It is nice to go to Creelers for a special occasion, a nice meal for an anniversary or something, but not for your average night. I don't think I'll be going back for a while, just because it's so expensive - but I'll be going back.No No  No!!

I drive past here three or four times a mont and every time it sends chills down my spine!! The customers they attract speaks volumes for what it is, and all the fat, old men shouting disgusting things at any female put me right off. I was sort of excited when a friend suggested we check it out though, it was like getting to see the spiders layer. I wasn't even nearly tempted to sit down or stay for more than 3 minutes. Dirty, Smokey, ripped furniture and not very nice!!You can't really go wrong with  a place like this! It is a cute little sandwich shop that offers everything from snacks to lunches.

Their food is good, and quite reasonable! As has been said before me, there is a good selection of everything and the staff are happy to help. Onto a winner!This place has saved my life on many, many occassions. That drunken stumble home has never been so good - the beacon of light in the distance fills my heart with joy.
Ok, let's remember what this place is...it's a chip shop aimed at the 2am market - don't expect anything more. It plays its role really really well.

They have good pizza's - as suggested by the title - and really yummy chicken pakora's too. 

10/10 pizza paradise! See you on Friday!This is the biggest theatre in Edinburgh and plays host to many brilliant musicals such as Les Miserables, We Will Rock You,  Mamma Mia, Blood Brothers, The Phantom of the Opera and many more. To be honest, when you're going to see anything mentioned above, you don't pay much attention to the surroundings.

I am a regular to the theatre as I play the violin and am often playing as a stand-in for the orchestra's. Not many people see the orchestra pit - and if I were reviewing it it would be getting 1 star - but to be honest you can always tell the standard of a theatre by the way back-stage is treated.  It is nice to look at - the red velvet seats and sweeping gold balconies are very impressive. the bar, however, is a bit run-down and the foyer could do with a lick of paint. As with all theatres, the seats are crammed in - i would thoroughly recommend getting a seat at the aisle or at the front of a row.
It suits its purpose as Edinburgh's biggest theatre, but it's no Carnegie HallWhat a great way to represent Scotland!! It's smack bang in the middle of  Edinburgh and is such a huge pull for everyone - not just tourists.
They have brilliant things in here, some a bit weird (but wonderful) and some simply amazing. As Jonathan M said, you can spend ALL day in here without thinking about it.
I came here once for a games-console exhibition. It was great! We could play all the old-school games and try out the new technology (which, at that time, was the wii).
It's absolutely brilliant in here, well worth a visit!It's a pretty good CD shop, if you're looking for something in particular. One of my friends released a CD that was only available in the Tesco in my local home-town, but I went into Coda and asked them about it and I had it within 2 days. Great!
The staff are really knowledgeable too, and if you want to find something new then this is definitely somewhere to come.Edinburgh really is a diverse city. 

There are a few Christmas shops in the city, including this gem at the bottom of the Royal Mile. I live in the Holyrood area so always walk past this treasure cavern of glitter, sequins and cinnamon. It's really nice to be able to be surrounded by fake snow and santa's in the middle of July. Yup, I'm the sort of person who loves that stuff.

Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe is very small, whenever I've been in with more than one other person I've had to leave because there simply isn't enough space. Saying that, however, it is not often that people venture that far down the Royal Mile, let alone visit a Christmas Shop. Although Cliff Richard once went in and bought a tree hanging. 
It's a really quaint place and I recommend it whole-heartedly for the little kids inside everyone.I like Zara - what's not to like! Their fashion is always amazing, they always seem to get it right even if it's not in all the magazines. It's quite refreshing to get away from bright floral prints and over-sized tee's.

I'm not sure what it is, but every single time I come to this particular Zara I get a splitting headache. I think it's something to do with their alarm, my mum gets it too. So I don't tend to stay too long! And I find it difficult in here to shop to be honest, although there is some order, I find it difficult to find things in the same place and often have to look around it to find it sitting somewhere else.
It' also a bit daunting to have the security men watching my every move - I feel guilty for being there. But I suppose the clothes themselves are more important than the shop - and so because of that Zara is a winnerI don't know what it is, but there's something about Montpeliers that I really quite like...

The bar/restaurant is part of a group in Edinburgh, owned by the same people who have Ricks, Opal, Tigerlilly etc  - for those who don't know, these are the 'posh' and 'fancy' bars in Edinburgh. The ones you have to wear the nice jewelry and extra mascara for. Not usually my cup-of-tea, but Montpelier is somewhat different....let me explain.

It is located in Bruntsfield, which is, in my opinion, Edinburgh's best kept secret. The small community has a really strong sense of family and security, which is embodied in Montpelier. In the summer you can sit outside on the busy street, Bruntsfield Place, and watch the world go by with a glass of vino. I always tend to form my opinion of a bar by the temperature of their white wine, I like mine verging on frozen, and my friends Montpelier's wine could give you frost-bite. They had a great selection of wine, as well as an extensive drinks menu for your pleasure. Whether choosing to sit in the ultra-chic woven seats outside or the ultra-trendy cosy sofa's inside, you would look trendy even if you're in your pyjamas. I saw Susan Boyle sitting outsite Montpeliers only last week, and she actually looked chic...!

Food-wise, there isn't a great selection, but every Sunday they do a great roast - great for hangovers and comfort food. The restaurant is small-ish, but quite cosy. There is always an atmosphere and it's always busy, no matter what time it is.
My only complaint would be the price - it is very expensive. I would recommend, therefore, that you make your visit to Montpelier a treat, only visit now and again.

I went to Montpelier on a first-date and it was perfect. Busy enough but quiet enough, but the bank was well and truly broken after 2 drinks each. You'll be glad to know that that romance went on for 18 months, but, sadly, ended. Even though I shouldn't, I would still go to Montpeliers for a drink with another suitor because the whole experience is too valuable to write off.
SO, to conclude, Montpelier would be the PERFECT place to go on a first date, or for a nice drink before a big event. It's a special place, so make the visits special.

I don't know what it is, but there's something about Montpeliers that I really quite like...I've since broken up with that no-good, sleaze of a boyfriend that took me here on a first date. Twat.

I've not realised that Mont Peliers isn't as great as I once thought! It's really really expensive, it's difficult to get to if you just want a drink - if you come here for a drink then you can't really go anywhere else without a taxi or a 25 minute walk. pfft.

It's small too, there are never enough seats and the outside ones are full of smokers!
It's alright though, not great, just alright. If you want to go here then it's not a bad place to be. Although the food takes AGES to come.Who still has a video player?? 

I do, that's who!!

It's so refreshing to see a place that sells videos as well as DVDs, so retro!!

The price is good and the selection is vast, what more do you want?!

The staff are lovely too, definitely note-worthy and lovely.It's a printers, it prints and photocopies things for you....not much else to it really!!

The price isn't OTT but is a bit eyebrow-raising. I agree with Stuart, the staff could work on their friendliness, but still, they're just there to maintain I suppose!

It's a good service to have!This place has everything you could every dream of. If I had al day, I would spend it in here.

they have the coolest stuff, from a hand-chandelier to novelty office stuff. The shop itself is really quite small, but I've never been in with more than one other person so you don't really notice the size.

They have the best and most amazing selection of greeting cards I've ever seen. Some are really lovely and pretty and some are just hilarious. I understand the point that you can't really buy silly stuff for yourself...but why not! I live for this stuff. Nobody every buys it for me because they think I've already got most of it, because I love it so much.
If I have a birthday coming up I'l go straight here.

Also they have a really great website!I don't know much about running, but I started training with my brother when he was running the Marathon ( i know, crazy right). We both came here to get proper running shoes - if you're into running you'll know how important the shoes are for the old knees!
The staff are absolutely lovely and extremely thorough. They want you to have the perfect equipment as much as you do!
When we came in here we were spoken through the whole shop and how they operate, and told about all the methods they use to make sure everything is just right!
They watch you run on the treadmill or walk on the spot to judge what you need. I must admit though, it can be really expensive if you want the good stuff, but I suppose it's worth it. My brother spent about £200 in here, but he needed it. I spent £200 on a pair of heels once, never wear them.When I first started playing the violin, I would come in here when I came to Edinburgh to browse through their music books. My family hated me for it, because I would spent more than an hour just looking and choosing which book I would take home with me. They had a great selection, that's where I got most of my repertoire! But don't be impressed - I'm talking about themes to movies and musicals! I must have about 30 music books with cds now.
I came here when I was a bit more advanced and was disappointed at how easy everything was. Still, their selection was brilliant. 
If you play an instrument and are just a beginner/intermediete (i.e. grades 1-4) then this is your goldmine. It served me very well and I appreciate it greatly for that!

I should point out though...the quality of their stringed instruments isn't the best. Again, if you're a beginner or an intermediate then it's absolutely fantastic, but anything beyond grade 6 I recommend you go to Stringers on Queen Street for a better quality instrument.Ok, I'm DEFINITELY not cool or edgy enough to be in here, but I'm here nevertheless.

Apart from the staff all appearing to be Gorgeous, it's all pretty average in here. It has a job to do - sell music and dvds, and it does it. Nuff said.

I don't think m fuscia y pink jacket and blue pumps fit in here...

The price is pretty decent though, if you're into this sort of things then I'm sure you can spend hours browsing, but I felt a bit out of sorts.There are a lot of Domino's branches in Edinburgh, but this one is definitely my favourite! The staff are really friendly and if you ask for anything extra or special they will deliver. My ex boyfriend once was trying to make it up to me for being a total twat and so ordered a pizza to spell out 'i love you' in pepperoni. Developing on from this, I always like to have my friends names on their pizza's, just to see the reaction on their face when they open it up. I get the feeling that not every branch will allow this (following a less than enthusiastic conversation with the Morningside Branch) so it just goes to show what a great branch this is.

Personally, I LOVE their BBQ Texas and Ham and Pineapple is a nice version. My favourite thing about Domino's is their little pots of garlic sauce to dip the crust into - genius! They often give you an extra pot too, if you order 2 pizza's. They have a great deal on every week too - particularly Two for Tuesdays. Check out the websites for your nearest and their deals. Seriously worth looking into!I had heard a lot about the Earl from my friends living in Marchmont, so I was really excited when they suggested we go there for our pre-drink rather than our usual haunt.
Firstly, I was surprised at how small the Earl was. There were around 25 seats, every one taken, and people standing everywhere. I bumped into a friend (literally bumped into him) but couldn't stop to chat because there seemed to be a one-way flow of human traffic around me. Don't get me wrong, it was a really nice wee bar with a lot of character to it, but I think it's reached a stage where it's reputation precedes its reality. I wouldn't choose to go there if I wanted a nice drink with my friends, but I would choose to go there if I wanted to re-live my first year at uni and socialize with Marchmont's elite.I'm quite a fan of good ole DP! Their clothes are reliable, on trend and always comfortable. Cast your mind back, have you ever found a hole in a DP t-shirt? have you ever ripped your DP jeans? Have you ever got a blister from DP heels? No.

This particular branch isn't anything special, has all the latest lines and reasonably priced!

My one criticism is with their mailing list - I am literally emailed EVERY SINGLE DAY!! Come on, is it necessary?I think I was being naïve in thinking that all Charlie Millers would be the same...!  When I went to this branch I had a totally different experience than the times I've visited the Harvey Nichols one. Firstly, the entire salon was empty, I was the only person there (and it was 4pm!) and all the staff were mucking around in the seats - I would do the same though.  The girl who cut my hair seemed to be the same age as me and although she was really lovely and chatty, she didn't do a very good job! I was getting a fringe cut in (or bangs, depending on where you are) and I have since found out that it was cut in a really bad way. It was really expensive too, I paid £38 for my average-cut! My friend came here the other week to get her hair dyed, and came out with a bleached jumper and stained jeans from the hair dye. 
I do like Charlie Millers, I like it a lot, but I will avoid this branch!I love Tesco, but this Tesco is too small, too busy and too often I've left the shop with nothing in my hands!!

No matter what day you go, or what time you go, it's always busy and you'll be queuing for ages. There are never any trollies or baskets so you'll end up carrying everything in your hands.

Now that they've opened up a self-service check out area it does smooth out the creases somewhat, but it's still horribly busy.Every Christmas I go in here to buy my grandparents a Jo Malone candle. To be honest, that's about the only thing that I will buy from here, what with the price of everything else n all.It is super expensive.

They have a great selection of cremes, perfumes and soaps, but I think their candle is the best. It lasts a full year (when used occasionally)  and smells great. I'm not such a big fan of their room-sprays, they're quite acidic and make the room smell worse.
I begin to wonder how they make their money, there never seems to be anybody in this shop (other than at Christmas) and the prices are ridiculous!Considering it's the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh doesn't have many ski/snowboard / extreme sport shops. But Alas! There's always Boardwise!

I used to come in here practically every week with my brothers, as they were really into snowboarding and roller-blading (remember that phase?!) . The other week I came in here just for a look, and I was shocked at what they had! Sure, whenever I used to come in I would sit in the corner and sulk that I wasn't getting to go to my shops so never really noticed their ladies selection. Talk about school-boy error!

They have a great range of bikini's, summer dresses, flip-flops, hoodies, bags and sunglasses! Yeah it's a bit summer-orientated, but summer is on its way afterall.
They have a good selection of guy's stuff too - infact, there is more for men than women, but plenty of both. 

I came out of Boardwise with an amazing red Quicksilver summer dress and a really bright bikini, all for under £30. It's definitely the sort of place I'll go back to, to begin my summer!I came in here to ask about sheet music, and sheepishly left when they told me, without any uncertainty, that they only sell piano music.  'But it's the same for violin!' i exclaimed! they were having none of it.

during my visit, however, I did manage to have a good look around. If you're into piano's and keyboards then maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did. I play the violin so don't know much about the old chords.

They also had quite a nice selection of piano music too. The staff were very knowledgeable and were playing a really jazzy duet when I arrived. However I was the only customer and I've barely ever seen anybody in here. It's a niche market, and if you didn't know it was here then you'd walk on byIt's not really fair that Internacionale gets quite a bad reputation...but to be fair it doesn't really do itself many favours. It's sort of tacky. 

The clothes they sell are definitely for young teenagers or people who are happy to go out in a napkin. Seriously, I once tried on a 'dress' here and it came above my belly button.

Although saying that, it is really cheap. I often see a lot of, erm, well, they're chavs in here. I know it's not really fair to add stigma but as I said it adds itself.Someone once told me that Armstrongs gets its clothes by looting the recently-deceased. I laughed at the time, but there is still a smell in the jumper I bought....

Armstrongs is a really edgy place to shop, it's mainly students who buy the old clothes and handbags. Every now and again, you come across something gorgeous, but my experiences have been less successful. I have only one thing from Armstrongs, a purple jumper which I always get comments about. You have to hand it to them, they have taste. The mannequins outside the shops are always dressed to perfection and always manage to lure me in, but I can never find those  great purchases. I know they are there, whether I'm not looking hard enough or they're all taken by the time I get there, I can never find them.

But, I have hope - I have the purple jumper to remind me that there are  somethings worth searching forOk so Xile can be pretty 'in your face' but at the same time it has some really good things. 
For example...

I had been hunting high and low for a particular Barbour jacket (don't judge me, it has good insulation). They had run out in the Barbour store, in Jenners and everywhere else practically, but low and behold Xile had it!! And they gave me 20% off because I asked for a discount. SWEET!
They stock the big boys, like Barbour, Ugg and all the other big names that are quite cool. Trust me, it's worth a look!You know what, you can't really fault Next. I'm only giving it 4* because it's just not quite there yet....don't you think?

It's like that underachiever in your class at school. The brains were there but they never did their homework and so didn't do well. The potential is there but it's just not channeled correctly....yet.

Everyone has a next outfit, right? It's pretty brilliant stuff if we're honest. All my teachers wore things from next.

This branch is quite good, quite big and the staff are really friendly. I always laugh at the fact their tills say 'Remember to smile' - as if you'd forget....!WOW!!! If there was an award for the cutest shop in Edinburgh, it would go to Nippers! I always used to walk past the baby-shop and never really took time to notice it much. Sure, the lilac and green shop-front isn't hard to miss, but I never really looked further than that. BIG MISTAKE. It was fate that brought me into the shop, my friend was looking for an outfit for a newborn baby and so we sauntered in. The first thing to strike me was the new-born baby smell - I'm only 20 but I want one.
The clothes are amongst the cutest and quirkiest I've ever seen. The best thing is the Scottish theme throughout - perfect for tourists looking for a Scottish memento for family and friends. Whether it's a baby-grow with a 'highland coo' or a bib saying 'aye, i'm cute' , it's the perfect place for all your baby-buying needs. Price-wise, yeah it's not cheap, but the quality is brilliant and the photographs of your baby in a Nippers outfit will last a lifetime!

From now on, I am stopped in my tracks walking past Nippers to see their latest stock and displays. It is located in a lovely part of Edinburgh and everyone who goes in comes out with a grin to challenge a cheshire cat.Ok, this is the one-stop baby shop. It never ceases to amaze me!! I came in here the other day and they had more stock, better prices and friendlier staff!
My friend just had a baby girl so I was looking for something small-ish to give her (she's not a close friend). I came across an adorable bib with a picture of a milk bottle saying 'I'll have a glass of the house white.' 

AWW!!This is the sort of place that you come if you like wine, but aren't like, really into it (well, I come here and I'm not exactly a connoisseur). Basically, what I'm trying to say is it's cheap, and it always stocks the 'coolest' brands and has almost always got a good deal going for it.

This particular branch is really big too, and I've often seen a lot of grafitti around the area - some entrepreneurial kids have changed the 'B' to an 'F' in the streets. Charming.

The staff are lovely too, but the grafitti in the area makes me a bit scared of this branch...but the shop itself is good.I agree with the previous yelp up to a point - yes the shoes are amazing, and yes they are pretty, but they are expensive and often give me blisters! It's the sort of place that you buy shoes to wear to an occassion, or  pair of black boots. You know, staple items that will provide dedicated service all year round. But it's the price that puts me off.This Sainsburys is huge, and is ALWAYS busy. It's one of the two supermarkets in the centre of town, and is definitely the cheaper of the two. If you manage to get a sandwich at lunch time, you're one of the few. I've never met anyone who has, I think it's an urban myth. 

This aside, they have all the stock of a Sainsburys and is surprisingly big considering it's in the centre of town. Saying this, I came in here once for a needle and thread and they didn't have it. What's up with that?!

to be honest, it's too busy and too big to be of any use!!I give all charity shops 5*, because their cause is great. The Salvation Army is no exception! The Salvation Army are a great charity, they're brilliant at what they do and so I support them in any way I can. Even if I'm just looking around, I like to come in here to show my support. They are really helpful in here, maybe a bit too helpful. but good nevertheless.

it's your typical charity shop, they sell anything and everything they can and it's all for a good cause!!

It's good to see it in this area too, because the area is quite nice and thus the things they have are really good.This place has everything, but I;m not going to lie...kinda freaks me out. 

Warning - childhood memory coming up....

When I was younger my gran would take me here or the other branches and she would spend ages pouring over all the creams and lotions, and all the shampoo smells and all the toothpaste qualities. So I associate Semi-chem with frustrated memories of choosing between 'berry blossom' or 'vanilla skies' because 'people can smell your hair you know.' 

Nostalgia aside, they have a lot of stock and it's all pretty decent. This shop is pretty small and narrow, however, and can get a bit cramped. Staff are lovely though.
You can't really go wrong with semi chemSomething about New Look always brings me back. I used to come here all the time when I was younger, and I still come back today!

However, I totally agree with Marj C, it really is in a grim setting. It's not the nicest of places and is really small. It's nothing special, and definitely doesn't represent the franchise well.

Their clothes are really nice though, the quality is good and are reasonably priced. I got a great little jacket here for £15 - yeah it's more of a winter jacket than a summer, but I can wait. I'm a patient person.one word - yuck.

I used to live in Bruntsfield as a student and so would frequent the local take-aways. Globetrotters was, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst. The chips were disgusting, worse than Macdonals or Burger King and the fish...oh my God call that fish? It was like cardboard. Totally tasteless and dripping in grease. Also, the staff were not pleasant, leeching on all the young girls in the shop (not just me) and making the whole experience quite unenjoyable. If you want fish and chips, or anything for that matter, go elsewhere.I don't know why I went back, but I did.

I should have re-read my previous review to remind me how absolutely horrible the food here is. It's dripping in fat it's chewy (are chips meant to be chewy?) and the staff eye you up suspiciously. I felt like a criminal.Ikea!! The staple-store in every home! Who hasn't got a seat or a bookcase from Ikea I ask you?
I think it's common ritual for people moving to Edinburgh, whether a student or not, to go straight to Ikea. Everyone needs furniture storage, right? Heck, I sometimes go just for a look around!
This shop is exactly like every other Ikea - literally - but if it ain't broke don't fix it.
I once came here with a group of friends and played hide and seek. The possibilities are endless, let me tell you!
The best part about this Ikea is the cushion section - you can have whatever you want and if they don't have your exact colours, they order it in for you. 
They have a great section too if you've not got enough nuts/bolts etc, all for free. I came back once because the clock I bought about 3 years previously had stopped working, and I got a full refund or exchange. 
I thoroughly recommend their fairy-lights too - the best I've ever had!I am somewhat of a movie-buff (ha, you will believe anything) and I LOVE renting out movies and going to the cinema. I've lived in a few different places in Edinburgh and so have been a member of a few different Blockbusters, but this particular branch in Newington has taken my fancy.

Firstly, it's really big so you just know that no matter how obscure or random the film you're looking for is, it's in there. Secondly, they have a Pick n Mix!! And its not the extortionate kind either, it's a modest £2.99 for a large tub and you can fill it up to your hearts delight. They also have a really good selection of snacks and drinks and almost always have cheap deals on their food.

The staff are always on hand to help and actually help you find the DVD you're looking for, rather than stand and point. I recently handed over a discount card that was out of date, and bless they gave it to me anyway!

This is a keeper!When I stayed in Pollock Halls, there was serious competition between Bierex and a few local pubs. But hey, a little bit of competition is healthy, right? Wrong..

Bierex is a really nice bar, nicely decorated and there is always a nice atmosphere, but there's nothing special to it. Where all the other pubs in the area are fighting with the cheapest drinks deals and offers, Bierex plays it cool in the background. I wish they would have special offers because I would definitely come here more often.

It is always busy and the prices aren't too bad, but you can get an awful lot cheaper around the corner. The food is good too, your bog-standard pub food,but again, around the corner you can get the exact same with freebies thrown in. It's worth at least one visit though.Um....

I know there is a bit of hype around Ann Summers shops, and I understand that it's not the sort of place to take your Gran, but it is one of those places that you have to go in at some point in your youth. I went in looking for an outfit for a fancy dress party - I wanted to look good but not skanky - there's a fine line. I was amazed at some of the things they sold - the toys and creams were wild, who thinks of this stuff?! I managed to find an  appropriate nurse outfit and tried it on - imagine my surprise to see my then-boyfriend peeping through a whole in the door.... specifically designed for this purpose!! I felt quite uneasy! 

When I got to the till (the outfit cost me £28 and was of a far greater quality than other things I had seen in fancy dress shops) I was offered a new 'bullet' vibrator. The lady was telling me how brilliant it was and how extreme the vibrations were. TOO MUCH INFORMATION. I hastily declined and retreated retreated retreated. I know it's the sort of shop that is quite controversial, and my outfit was really quite nice for a fancy dress party, but I'm not going back in a hurry!I think the 3 star sort of summarises this shopping centre/food court/tourist attraction. It's pretty average.

They have some brilliant shops down here - Topshop, French Connection and Warehouse, but the whole place just feels so sad. There is no atmosphere and there is no sense of enjoyment. On paper, Ocean Terminal should be a tourist paradise and attract heaps of Edinburgh locals but in reality it just isn't doing it!! They have a VUE cinema here which is brilliant, I've been a few times because it's always really quiet and there's free parking (woohoo!) so it's a winner all round. The food courts aren't brilliant, there is a nice view of the docks from some of them, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here.

Saying that, the John Lewis and other shops are worth visiting if you have a purpose. As I said, the free parking is its main selling point!Eugh!!

This place was cold, sterile and not very nice. When I came I felt like I was walking into a 70s bingo hall, the decor is somewhat outdated, and the staff were nothing short of rude!

I ordered a gammon steak and it was tough, they forgot the egg on top and my plate was overflowing with chips.

The entire time I was there I was surrounded by drunken lads, roudy gals and drunken louts. It was a horrible experience and I don't plan on returning!I really love Marks and Spencer's food, they produce high quality things in really high quality packaging. Not that the packaging really matters...

This particular Marks and Spencer is just for food, and is the perfect size. The aisles are wide enough for 2 or even 3 people to pass comfortably and everything is laid out clearly. Unlike most other Marks and Spencer's in Edinburgh, this one is never really too busy so it's a nice experience rather than a stressful one.
If you ever need or fancy food shopping in Marks and Sparks, this is the one to come to.I used to come to HMV all the time, but then they introduced a silly scheme instead of the student discount. T'suh!

But I can't resist it. You can't really fault HMV, they have everything. And if they don't have it, they'll order it for you. The staff in this branch are what makes it special, to me anyway. They are so friendly and lovely! Often I feel that people trying to help you in shops are just doing it for their commission or whatever, but in HMV they genuinly want to help you. I was looking in the jazz section just the other day and one of the guys working told me to check out Eilleen Hunter, an 'upcoming and promising jazz artist' . You can't buy that sort of service!You know what, I can't help but love this place.

Yeah it's cheap, yeah it's crappy, yeah the staff aren't overly-cheerful and yeah the shop is crowded with shoes....but it's funny, right?

Who doesn't like this sort of place?! It's great if you're looking for a place to buy a cheap pair of shoes for a specific event, where you don't care if you wreck them.I had heard amazing things about this kebab house, but not being a kebab lover myself  I didn't know how to judge it. I was surprised at how tasty the meat was - I didn't think the huge chunk of meat on the spit looked appetizing until it was sliding down my throat.

I must admit I've only been once and it was following a rather liquid lunch, but I'll be back and explore the menu further....but so far so very, very good!I always go through phases when it comes to games. Sometimes I am totally addicted to the likes of Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Maro kart, but sometimes I couldn't think of anything I'd want to do less.

It's a love hate thing, it loves me, i hate it...

But to be fair, Gamestation is a brilliant place for those phases where I love it. It's got all the games you could want, and if it doesn't have them then they happily order them in for you.
The staff are very knowledgeable and sincere, they want you to get what you want. They have a good deal too where you can trade in games, for a good price!!I've often seen the Spice Box advertised on a few websites for take-away food, so I decided to go and check it out. It's a relatively small place but it holds its own!
I get the impression that it has a bit of a cult following, as on more than one occassion I've met the same faces ordering their food.

The price is a bit hefty, and to be honest the food isn't spectacular, but it's good nevertheless and worth a look!This is quintessential Scottish pub at it's best. It's amazing, there's no other way of putting it.

Edinburgh is a funny place, because although it is a huge city, you never actually feel like you're in a city. Probably because there's a great big bloody hill in the middle of it, but still. But if the city ever gets too much, I always go to the Sheep's Heid. It is about 25minutes from the city centre but you could be on a remote island in the middle of the North Sea.

It has such a great atmosphere, and has brilliant live music every week.This is the sort of place that I have to stop in my tracks to look at. I'm not sure if that's a good thing though...it's a more of a 'wtf??' moment that a 'oh wow!' moment. Seriously, some of the clothes in here are just downright wierd.

they source all their stock from all over the world, but always always has an expensive label and thus an expensive price tag on it. Sometimes you can get an absolute diamond outfit in here - my brothers girlfriend got a stunning orange D&G dress here once, but the majority of the time it's for the older lady trying to look  like Kirsten from the OC.This place gets a bit of a bad name. It's not chavvy really....let's just take it for what it is. It's a sports shop, it sells sporty things. You can get most basic sporting items here - gym clothes, running shoes, hoodies etc, it's all here. So what, you might get mugged when you're there, it's still good for what it is and what it costs.When I was younger I loved this place, it was the epitome of cool and all things trendy. When  I would come home donned in new outfits, my friends all rushed to the nearest USC to get their hands on the same gladrags. 
However, now that I'm a bit older I appreciate that it doesn't all depend on the name or the label. And to be perfectly honest, I think that's what USC is all about. They sell bog-standard teenage stuff. It can be quite nice if you really look, or now and again they have really decent stuff. But overall, I think I've passed my USC stage, but that doesn't mean you have!!

They always have lovely window displays in this branch, which always gets me into the shop. For about 2 minutes.What a cool name!! They have a really big novelty moustache and nose over the door too - class!! If that's not enough to get you in, what is?

Ok, it's a bit small inside, and if it's busy then it's hellish. The staff are almost always busy and it's difficult to get attention sometimes. 

Their costumes are extensive!! They have everything you could want really, and some of it isn't too expensive. They have lots of joke things too, my favourite is the bangers. Never gets old.I've always heard good things about the Dakota hotel, but never been tempted to go. Whenever I think 'where will I go for dinner tonight?' the Dakota doesn't quite jump to mind. But it should have...

When I eventually made it to the Dakota I was blown away. I was there with my mum as there was a deal on - 'just the two of us', dinner bed and breakfast for £139. Bargain! The restaurant is really nice, with a wall dedicated to The Rat Pack and heaps of photographs everywhere. It was really nice. The food was delicious too - I had crab then lemon sole with veg. The restaurant prides itself on its fresh fish (it has won many awards) and the pork belly - which my mum said was the best meal she'd had in years.

Although it was quite far out, the restaurant was packed. It was a victim of its own success to a point, however, as there were lots of queues and people waiting around.

I was disappointed in the breakfast however, they ran out of croissants,  sausages and marmalade. GUTTED!There's something quite delicious about Lush, isn't there?!

They have the most amazing bath salts and lip-balms and bath bombs and shower gels and anything that makes your body look and smell delicious!

My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The best thing about Lush is their chocolate lip-balm, it's one of the best i've ever used and tasted delicious!
The staff are really friendly here too, happy to help and the proof is in the pudding - they're all beautiful!Fat Face is for the those of us who like to go on walks and have dreadlocks..kinda. It's sort of a indie, hippie shop but with gorgeous fashions and really beautiful patterned dresses. We all have a friend who is into that sort of stuff, right?  It's for the surf-short-wearing, quicksilver-bikini type kid in all of us!

This shop is laid out well and the staff are really super duper. They are friendly and annoyingly cool. It's pretty reasonable too, but maybe a bit on the expensive side. Worth a looky look though!You can't go far wrong with Imo really, they're the best when it comes to washing cars (apart from my mum, she has the knack). 
They market themselves as being the cheapest carwash around, and I quite believe they are. They have different choices for your car at different prices - ranging from around £2 to £6.50. You can't deny, they do a good job. You can either chose to get it hand-washed by them or through the machine. Go for the machine - they have multicoloured foam! I know it's kinda childish, but there's something magical about being surrounded by pink, blue, green and yellow foam. It's like I'm in a bah of skittles.I came here at 12 one day for a girly lunch...but they wern't serving food. What?!
But, out of the goodness of their heart, they served us. The kitchen didn't open till1 - which I found a bit odd. However, the food I did get was really quite nice! I had chicken Satay with a flatbread and sour cream and it was delicious! A little bit spicy though. I would go back, just for that dish.
My friends both had burgers, and they said they wern't anything special. The whole time we were there, the bar was empty and we listened to the staff moaning about each other. The staff all had back-combed hair and holes in their tights - make your own opinion.

Overall, although I really enjoyed my food I wasn't extremely impressed with 56 North. It has potential though, I plan on coming here on a sunny day and sitting outside and watching the world pass me by.For all your Whisky needs!!...

Cadenhead's is exactly what you would expect from a whisky shop on the Royal Mile. It's aimed at tourists who want to experience Scotland, but I have a family friend who frequents Cadenhead's as their selection is whisky is amongst the best in the city.

I'm not a whisky lover (yey - i think it's the sort of thing that comes with age) and so I didn't appreciate it totally, but I do know that Cadenhead's is a brilliant place to stock up. They even offered samples so I could see which one I would have liked. If you're looking for whisky, Cadenhead's is as good as any.I used to come here all the time when I was in first year, my dad would take me and I would stock up on jeans, cardigains and tights  - the things you can get away with being cheap. Although it's cheap, the clothes I've bought here are amongst the longest lasting i've ever had! I always go for the staple items, but they always have really good fashion items too.

This particular branch is huge but it follows an easy-to-understand pattern in the shop. it's sort of like ikea, just walk around and you'll find yourself at the till! Brilliant!The Scottish Parliament has had some stick in its time! OK, I know it looks weird and I know some people hate it, but I don't think it's that bad! Granted I've lived right next to it for the past year and so I might have learnt to like it, but I think the exterior is really quite different and unique. What would have been the point in having a normal parliament building, just like every other one? It's a talking point. It looks AMAZING from above... unfortunately that's not the most common angle to view it from.

As well as being something to look at, you can go in and sit in on debates too. I sat in on the anti-smoking debate in July 2006 and it was electric. It's really exciting to watch policies being created...albeit a bit boring after a while. It's definitely worth a visit though.If there's one thing you know about me, yelpers, it is that I love stationary.  It's my Achilles! I can spend a fortune in here quite happily!

As has been said before me, Paper Tiger is such a cute shop! I often come along Lothian road for this shop alone.

It  is such a lovely shop! Very cool - I always feel ultra sophisticated in here. I like to picture myself in here in ten years time as a yummy-mummy getting things for my high-powered job with Jonny Depp on my arm. It could happen.

Seriously, Paper Tiger is my numero uno stationary stop in the city - and I love them all. This is my fav!I totally agree with Eleanor on this one - I absolutely adore Karen Millen but can't exactly afford the £200+ price tags! Saying that, I bought a drop-dead gorgeous purple dress 2 years ago and I wear it every Christmas and every big event, and it does wonders for my figure. For those familiar with my reviews, I tend to mention my hips. But wearing my Karen Millen dress, what hips?

My mum, with a steady pay cheque and a sugar-daddy spends a fortune in this shop. No wonder, they have high prices, their clothes are amazing. They always seem to get the trends just right, and they always have a matching pair of shoes and a clutch for every outfit.  If you have an important event coming up, or you just feel like spoiling yourself, hit Karen Millen. You won't regret it, but your purse might. Put it on the visa, deal with it next month.My friends call me thrifty nifty....I'm somewhat of a thrift and haberdashery master you see.

So I love shops like this, they're right up my street. They have everything in this place, from threads of all sizes and colours to skirtings to personalise your clothes/curtains/couches with.
the great thing about this place is the staff too. I often come in here a bit unsure about what I'm looking for, and they always give great advice. They know their stuff, that's for sure.

It's also relatively cheap too! One of the better haberdashery shops in the city, for sure!This place looks an awful lot better than it acually is.

First of all,  beware of the step. There's a step right as you walk into the shop. What a stupid place to put a step. My first time in here I fell into the shop, and instead of people rushing to help me , I was laughed at. Mocked!! By the staff!!

Anyway, the costumes are pretty good  I must admit, but are ridiculously over-priced. They have a good selection of face-paints, but once theyre gone, theyre gone. 
It's full of students as it's right next to uni , and lets be honest the only time we've ever really put in a big effort to get dressed up is when we're students.

It's expensive, often out of stock and they laughed at me.I didn't really know what to expect from Penhaligon's, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's a small shop yeah, but it packs a punch with what it sells. It's nice to see it holding its own on George Street.

The price is a bit hefty, but the quality is high. As my Gran would say, really bonny!Edinburgh doesn't have a Primark, and the Matalan's are miles outside the centre, so BHS is the one-stop-shop for students looking for nice staple items for fancy dress or for anything your heart desires!
SAying that, they have a good selection of jumpers, underwear and general clothes....mainly staple items but still, everyone needs a pink t-shirt, right?

The price is cheap, but not really cheap. It's worth a look thoughI totally agree with  Fiona H, you would never know this place was here unless you went looking for it!

But once you've found it - you've struck gold!

It's one of the better places in Edinburgh to stay in, it's quiet, it's trendy enough and it's central! If you know Edinburgh, it's a good place to stay. Because of its location, in Newington, if you don't know the city then you'll end up spending quite a bit of money on taxi's, when it's a perfectly nice 15 min walk from the city centre.

Have a look online, there is usually a decent deal on for weekend  breaks. The concierge in here is brilliant too - my mum came here once and asked the concierge to surprise her and she had the best day ever - they organised a city tour (she didn't have the heart to tell them she always comes to Edinburgh) and a nice dinner! lovely!THIS IS MY FAVOURITE PLACE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD

I can't put it into words how much I absolutely love the Bargain Store. It does exactly what it says on the tin - gives a great bargain. If I ever need anything, anything at all I come straight here because chances are they'll have it.

Doormats, crystal ornaments, hoovers, lightbulbs, fancy-dress outfits, stationary, chocolates, towels, pet-things - EVERYTHING!

When I was in first here I practically lived here. If I had a fancy-dress event coming here I would get everything I needed in one swift stop.

It is directly opposite Edinburgh University too so I got all my stationary, folders and textbooks from here.

Please, please, please go to the bargain store. It's amazing!If you're a student in Edinburgh.....or if you're in Edinburgh in general, you HAVE to get a barbour jacket, dah'ling.

Seriously, the quilted pattern has become somewhat of a trademark in George Square, alongside Jack Wills slouch-pants and back-combed, back-sprayed, and dragged-through-the-hedge-backwards hairstyle. And that's just the men.

I went in with my mum, hesitantly, as I knew the stigma that came with the seemingly innocent jacket, but I was quite impressed. There is definitely a style - quilt - but there's a lot more to it than that. I ended up buying a wax jacket for a mere £69 and I wear it all the time. Yeah there is a stigma, but not for all the jackets! The staff were really friendly too and ordered in a jacket for my mum, and even though she didn't buy it in the end, they were really lovely.

I'm just worried about the condition of my hair now...Umm...I'm not a man, so this is probably biased. BUT I have two brothers and a dad, thus I often find myself in here sitting around or giving opinions etc etc.

Whoa, what a shop. If men are into shopping this is their haven. Everyone loves a man in a suit, and I love a man in a Slaters suit.
The quality is brilliant, I never really noticed how important the cut of a mans suit was until I watched people try on suit after suit until they got the one that was juuusssttt right (sorta like Goldielocks).

As well as being gorgeous, the staff are extremely helpful and attentive.

The missing star is for the price though....maybe that's how much a suit costs these days, but c'mon, really?WH Smith is expensive - I totally agree - but it pretty much has anything you could possibly want for your journey!!
I often choose to go in here for a sandwich + magazine just because I know it's reliable. The sandwiches are ok - nothing special but c'mon, it's WH Smith. It can be really expensive if you go crazy!! They normally have a good deal on when you get to the counter, either chocolate or a drink, and they almost always have a lunch-deal too.

It was designed badly, however. It's a train station, so everyone is going to have luggage. So I guess that's why they decided to make the aisles REALLY NARROW.I am often lured into Cult by their window displays - they always look really cool and appeal to my fashion taste. However, I think everyone thinks this because they never have said window-displays left in the shop - or if they do it's X X S. But they always have really pretty things in the shop anyway - it's your standard floral-print pixie-dresses and high-waisted shorts/skirts, but if you're desperate for something to wear then you'll find it here. You know when sometimes you open your wardrobe and think 'pffft' , my first point of call is Cult because they always have something nice.
Although all their stock is jumbled all over the place, it can be hard to find something. But at the same time, there's something really satisfying about finding a beautiful dress at the very back of a rack!

I bought my ex boyfriend a really nice pair of sweat pants a week before we broke up, they cost me £49 - so it's still a but of a sore point. Jonny - if you're reading this, I want my money back.I agree with Marj, the window display looks a hell of a lot better than the inside. They play the game well!!

The clothes are cool though, it's worth spending a bit of time looking around.

It's pricey though, watch out for that.

The staff are really friendly and annoyingly cool too. Wish I could be as cool as that.I was once told that this was the place to get your groceries if you're a 'yah'. How else can you excuse paying over £4 for a loaf of bread?? If Daddy's paying, that's how.

To be honest, this branch does well because it has to. It's right in the epicenter of studentsville, particularly in a place where all the 'lads' live, thus plenty young men looking for rolls and bacon for that 'epic night' before. It pretty much does well because the market's there...when you're desperate, £4 is a decent price to get your carbs.This is a club for 'edgy' people, as my flatmate would say. It's the sort of place you go to in jeans and a top and yesterdays make-up and fit in nicely!!
i live at the bottom of Holyrood Road, so I can hear the 'oonce oonce oonce' till the wee hours, but it's not so bad. Also the only cash machine in the area is right outside my flat, so that's a bit of a nuisance! 
The club is quite big, it's very dark so you don't notice the mess!!

During the day, however, it's a really nice little internet cafe serving really yummy paninis and lunch stuff! I was really surprised to learn it was a cafe too! Really is a good find, and a great place to use the internet (which is free if you have lunch!)I love Shelter. They are a brilliant organization and work hard. I always pop into this branch when I can, partly because it's Shelter and partly because their window displays always look great! It's quite lucky in that its located in a central area of the city, with a sphere of influence on wealthy parts and student parts. Supply and Demand right there

The staff in particular are lovely. They are not pushy at all and are the smiliest people I've ever come across! They genuinely enjoy their job, no wonder. job satisfaction must be high! 
It's definitely worth a visit, and it's a worthy cause....buy something!I've never understood why Papilio is never busy! They do great lunch and dinner offers, and is in one of the main student areas. Cheap food + students = perfect! But whenever I'm in here there's never an atmosphere. But that doesn't put me off!

This Italian restaurant is really traditional in style and taste. You can tell that everything they make is made on premises and tastes really fresh. As a consequence the service is a bit on the slow side, but the food is delicious. Hearty food. Ever since my first visit I've always gone for the Spaghetti Carbonara (I know, adventurous) and I always have it because it is so delicious! Their portion sizes are just right, and everything looks delicious. My mum highly recommends the Smoked Salmon pasta, and she has good taste!This is the sort of place that you come if you like wine, but aren't like, really into it (well, I come here and I'm not exactly a connoisseur). Basically, what I'm trying to say is it's cheap, and it always stocks the 'coolest' brands and has almost always got a good deal going for it.

This particular branch is really big too, I've come here with my mum before and found myself trailing after her for aaggeess incase she see's something she didn't see before...ok mum.

The staff are lovely too, really nice and happy to help and I'm sure if you asked nicely enough they would let you taste it too...Ok, call me old fashioned, but I have one favourite chip shop in the whole wide world, and to me anything else just doesn't meet the standard set by it. This kinda includes Franco's....but not exclusively!! They sell good things, it's a chippy so has all the usual, the staff are alright, and the prices are pretty reasonable....but it's just not my chip shop. 
To be honest the fish wasn't the best the last time I had it, but hey, wasn't a bad try.Show me someone who hates Boots and I'll show you a man that can walk on water. Everybody loves Boots!! How can you not?

Their points system was revolutionary to the market at the time, and still is! I collect all my points throughout the year by making relatively small purchases (such as the amazing meal deal) regularly and can afford to buy most of my Christmas presents with the points I've collected. It just means that my brothers are going to get new razors every year, but hey!!
Their meal deal is completely brilliant too - a sandwich, drink and snack for less than it would cost you to get to work in the morning. Result!!

This aside, I don't really like this branch. I find the St James' centre really intimidating so avoid it where I can. There are nicer branches! Plus, because it's quite central there are never any sandwiches left! boo!This just adds to the absolutely amazing city that is Edinburgh. It is so full of culture and this just proves my point. The Film Festival is amazing, nothing short of fantastic. I wish there were more adjectives I can use to tell you how brilliant it is. 
It coincides with the fringe festival at one point, so the city is full of people from all walks of life. Rather eclectic actors for example, are always walking the streets. Rupert Everett is a regular, as is Stephen Fry, Alan Davies and Iain Mackeller. 
It really is a great part of the city. Edinburgh comes alive during the film festival, it's brilliant!!Whatever you want, or whatever you need (wait, isn't that the Argos themetune?) .... anyway, you can get it here.

I used to come here all the time when I stayed in Pollock Halls for the most silliest things. When I was going as a smurf for a fancy dress party, I came here for red gloves and boots. When I was Michael Jackson, I came here for white gloves. Basically, what I'm trying to say here is if you go to Homebase with a little imagination you can get whatever you want!

Jokes aside, it really is a decent place for home-based stuff. It is very similar to B&Q, Halfords and all the other home furnishing stores, but Homebase has a quality about it that makes me want to go back

It is quite difficult to navigate though, I had to ask for directions twice. My mum told me that I once got lost in here and they had to announce it over the tanoy. How embarrassing.Jenners is one of Edinburgh's trademarks. It was taken over by House of Fraser a few years ago and I think everyone was anxious that it would turn into your bog-standard department store, but I'm glad to report the magic is still there. It's brilliant to visit over Christmas as they have a huge Christmas tree in the middle of the store, going all the way up to the top floor. It's an old department store and you can tell that in its day it was the swankiest joint in town. It still has that slight old-lady feel to it but somehow still captures a young audience  - myself included. I love going to Jenners, I could spend all day in here.

If you don't know your way around the Edinburgh shops then I would highly recommend you spend time in Jenners, all the main shops in the city are in here anyway and it's very Scottish.Woohoo! As good as it gets!

The staff are lovely

The watches are brilliant

The price is reasonable

Bien!who doesn't love Baguette Express?!

This place is great. I thoroughly recommend the coronation chicken (the non-spicy one)  and brie. Ok ok I know it's odd, but who ever thought that ham and cheese would go together!

The staff are lovely. Really friendly and really happy to help.

This is one of my favourite places to eat when I'm studying, it's so good and very very tasty.This place is cool Really cool.

It;s the sort of place you come when you feel 'edgy'. It's small, but it packs a punch!!

The staff are lovely, and the amount of stock they have is amazing. They have everything from S Club 7 to Shaggy. 

As my friend Tony would say, Grrreeat!I want to eat everything in here. It just smells so delicious and looks even better. 

Their body butter is TO DIE FOR. Especially Pomegranate, it's absolutely delicious. Other favourites include Strawberry, Orange and Apple.

The body shop is a shop dedicated to your body, and I often wish I could spend hours in here, but I often find the staff pounce on you and put pressure on you to buy something. Don't get me wrong, everything in here is a high quality, but I like to browse. It's amazing though!!This place has everything, but I;m not going to lie...kinda freaks me out. 

Warning - childhood memory coming up....

When I was younger my gran would take me here and she would spend ages pouring over all the creams and lotions, and all the shampoo smells and all the toothpaste qualities. So I associate Semi-chem with frustrated memories of choosing between 'berry blossom' or 'vanilla skies' because 'people can smell your hair you know.' Ok Gran.

Nostalgia aside, they have a lot of stock and it's all pretty decent. This shop is pretty small and narrow, however, and can get a bit cramped. Staff are lovely though.This is the sort of place I only ever came with my mum, because I never really appreciated it. Turns out, it's a pretty good wine shop!!
They have a huge selection and almost always have really good deals on.
The staff here are really friendly too , and happy to help. They can order in a bottle if you're looking for something specific. Very reliable and very good!I love this place, I always feel super clever when I'm browsing the shelves! It's a great place!

I especially love to come here when I need to buy some presents. The downstairs books are great  - they literally have everything! I've bought a few good fashion books and brilliant selection of memorabilia! 

There's something about the smell of books that's really quite special, isn't there?! They have it in abundance here!
If you have an hour to spare, spend it in here, it's absolutely brilliant!What a cool name! And what a cool place! I went into this shop when I first moved to Bruntsfield and agreed with Schwartzenegger - I would indeed be back. They have a lovely selection of shoes and the whole place was decorated really tastefully.

However, the shop is small and space is limited, ... shoes are therefore limited. I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed that there were only a few pairs of shoes out. They were lovely shoes too - heels, flats, boots - I bought a gorgeous pair of brown patent ankle boots. I also bought a really nice, unusual purple belt which I always get compliments on. It was a nice shop and has a great deal of potential, I just wish there was a greater selection. I've not been back since that first visit - partly because I had a feeling it would be the same stock and partly because I know I would spend more money if I did, but I peer in the window now and again to keep an eye out. It;s definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in the area, but don't go to any trouble.I've lost count of the amount of times that this Greggs has saved my life.  Sometimes, you need saturated fat. Sometimes, you need pastry. sometimes, you need greggs.

The thing is though, it's actually pretty good! I used to be quite embarrassed walking in here, but now I can walk in with my head held high! Their sandwiches are made fresh on the premises, and if they don't have your preference then they make it there and then!
Their sausage rolls though...uhhhh their sausage rolls....they bring me to my knees! You can get two for £1 if you're lucky.

This branch is really good too because they have huge patio doors that are always open, so the shop feels really open and airy.Whenever I walked past this window I always peered in - curiosity, y'know! The name always intrigued me - what would they be faking and how fabulous is fabulous? 

Turns out not very. The things in the window are nice yeah, but they have  done what all less-great shops do, they put all their good stock in the window. I was disappointed at the small selection inside, and found all the pieces a bit too costume-like for my tastes. If you're looking for something in particular for an outfit, then chances are you'll find something here, but otherwise it's not the sort of place to look for something modest. I thought the shop title, Fabulous Fakes, would suggest cheap cheap cheap! But I was surprised that everything was a bit costly. It's a shame, I think it has potential!I'm not really into this sort of stuff....but if I was, this is the place I would come to!! 
It has some really beautiful and unique pieces of jewelry and as Marj said,really quite kitschy and retro. It's refreshing to have a place like this in the centre of town.
The price tag isn't too bad either!! it's really reasonable for what you're getting, and everything is so unique.
If you like statement pieces of jewelery and eye-catching colours, or maybe something to spice up an outfit, this is the place!Ok. I'm going to level with you here. This place has saved my life on many, many occasions. I have a few friends in Glasgow so I take the train back and forth regularly, usually hungover, so this is the fatty, yucky food I need in that position.
Ok, it;s Burger King, it's not exactly going to be Fois Gras, but it's delicious nevertheless. People have a go because it's not healthy or whatever, but sometimes you just need it. You know what  I mean....right?I always feel like I've come straight from the black and white movies when I'm in here, red lipstick and cocktail dress in tow. There's something quite cool to say you're going to a jazz bar, and I like to click my fingers as I walk down the steps.

It's a hit or a miss with the jazz you get when you're there - if it's the house band then great (the pianist in particular can knock out some tunes) but sometimes they have guests which can be amazing, and can be bad. 
Overall, definitely a fan!This place always gives me the creeps!! I'm going to keep this short and simple....

It's dirty, the carpet always has food mushed into it, the tables are never cleaned properly, the wine is warm (!!), the food is horrible re-heated crap, the prices are extortionate and the staff are moody.

I;ve been here several times and come to the same conclusion. I thought it was ok because it was beside the cinema etc etc - don't make the same mistake I did!!I can't help but giggle in here....my old flatmate (who nobody liked very much) came in here once complaining of having a really sore lady-part. After a short interview the pharmacist concluded that it was probably the fact that my ex-flatmate had just been to see her boyfriend for the weekend and had too much fun...hehe!

Jokes aside, this is a decent enough pharmacy. I agree with Jonathan M, it's a friendly place and generally nice enough. It's pretty average really....Superdrug always seems to have everything!! If only it had a good meal deal, it would be putting Boots out of service!

This branch is quite small and compact but has everything nevertheless. Ok, it's a bit of a genetic place but it delivers every time!! The perfume in particular is slightly cheaper than most other places on the high street. 

Plus they have bright pink bags. Cool!I was once told that this was the place to get your groceries if you're a 'yah'. How else can you excuse paying over £4 for a loaf of bread?? If Daddy's paying, that's how.

To be honest, this branch does well because it's in the epicenter of 'yah's-ville. This part of the New Town caters for all walks of life....but mostly those walking in Uggs and Jack Wills jumpers with the occasional Barbour jacket/pashmina combo. They can afford to live in the New town as a student, thus they can afford ridiculous prices for their groceries. Spiffing.You can't really go wrong with this place! they have amazing options, really healthy and outline the exact benefits they have to you. Brilliant!!

The staff are really knowledgeable and make it look like the easiest thing in the world to whip up a smoothie! 

It's quite cheap and it;s well worth the trek, although there are other branches of this place in the city. If you pass it by, stop and have a smoothie!Everyone loves Boots - fact.

They have a great meal-deal here, I'm sure you all know and love it as much as I do, but this particular branch is sold out before the cannon goes off  at 1pm.

Toiletry-wise, it pretty much has everything. And the pharmacy is well stocked too, with professional staff.I was enticed into GoDiva because of the really unique clothes in the window. Everything was so different and eye-catching, I had to go in.

Its location isn't the best, it's just off the grassmarket in an area that people generally wouldn't wander to, but I quite like that. The clothes and accessories are all made by Edinburgh College of Art students/graduates and every single piece is different. I absolutely love the summer dress I bought here and am always being asked where I got it from. When I first bought it, I felt the neckline plunged a bit low for my liking, but within an hour I had a brand new fabric sewn on and it was perfect. The great thing about this shop is if you want anything altered/changed/a specific colour, you can get it done!

All in all, it's a really trendy shop and really edgy. I can't recommend it highly enough. It is a bit expensive though, that summer dress cost me £120! But I get a lot out of it, and I get the impression that all the clothes in GoDiva would be worth the splurge.I really like Oasis, and all their clothes are really nice....but I've found that with this store they tend to put all their effort into their window displays and not the actual store.

Don't get me wrong, the displays are brilliant, but it's at the cost of the shop floor. It's a bit like a constant sale, always having to rummage for what you want in the right size. When you get it though, it's great.

the staff are really nice too, really trendy and always work the clothes well. On more than one occasion I've bought an outfit I've seen modeled on the staff. The upstairs is much better than downstairs, and  their accessory area can get a bit crowded.This place is totally over-priced! Ok the castle is great and it's definitely worth the visit, but you can't really justify spending over £50 on an apron, can you? Even if it does have a picture of a haggis!

They have a great selection though, lots of clan names and details and different fudges and the like. Very touristy, and only tourists would buy this stuff really. I don't know many people with a cut of their family tartan, or their family clan post-card on their kitchen fridge.To reitterate Jonathan, this place is a mess.

But.....it does exactly what it says on the tin. Thus, you can't really complain too much about it!! It's Pound Savers and it saves you money. Since becoming a student I've got into the habbit of buying small things I may need - cloths, towels, soaps etc - from bargain stores just like this one. I then am surprised when my towels get holes and my soap makes my skin go funny. But it saves me money, so let's not get choosey.

They have everything you would ever need here, it was a heck of a novelty for me when I first came to Edinburgh. But watch out - I found myself buying total crap just because it was cheap. I now have a post-box piggy bank, three slinkeys and a bunch of stickers.To reitterate Jonathan, this place is a mess.

It has a horrible habbit of using sequins, feathers and shoulder pads in all the ways they shouldn't be used. There is a glitter and sequin extravaganza when you walk in, which often tempts me to turn right back round again. But if you persevere you can often find some quite nice things in here

Avoid the dresses though, they are so skin tight nothing is left to the imagination - and that's the best part!

Their jeans are always really nice, and they have great quality t-shirts and tops. Their handbags too are really good, but in my experience their jewelery isn't so hot.Ocean Terminal really is a one-stop shop. It has everything!! Including Trespass.
they are all things outdoor. Tents, backpacks, hiking boots, jackets, trousers, everything.

The staff are really friendly too, more than happy to help and extremely knowledgeable. The price is a bit much, but I'm told that this is typical of outdoor places.I'm not a golfer, so excuse the lack of technical knowledge here. I am, however, a student and always out on pub golf nights. Thus, I've been in here a few times for inspiration - but never bought anything because it's quite pricey.
They sell all your typical golf needs - clothes, putters, shoes etc etc. It's your one-stop-golf shop!
the staff are really friendly too, I always feel quite bad for looking around and not buying. They must have cottoned on by now, surely.

Overall, if you need inspiration or if you want something golf-related, this is your place!!If only I knew about this place when I was younger!!

I came here recently with some family friends and their kids, I was told 'this will shut them up for a while'. Screw the kids, I was the quietest I'd been in months! They have the most amazing selection of bears, quite literally anything you could possible want, they can make. I chose a beautiful toffee bear with curly fur. I then had to choose what sort of heart I would like it to have - yeah, they have a heard!! You can even get a motor put in so you can listen to its heartbeat. How friggin cool is that!!
They also offer sounds and music you can record yourself to put in the bear, so when you squeeze it your tune bellows out. The bear then goes into this machine where they bring it to life - you can choose how soft you want it to be - and then it's all yours!

It's such a brilliant experience, I only hope that the recession hasn't hit this place when I have kids.
the bear cost me £28, but it was thoroughly worth it.footlocker has become somewhat of a staple item on Princes Street. The black and white bags are everywhere.  I don't really see the attraction personally, I find it quite boring really. But people love it!
It's not bad, I mean, it's shoes!! You can't go wrong with it really. But don't come in here looking for a slammin pair of heels to match that dress, think trainers and black school shoes.The 3 times I've been in here, I've felt really uneasy. Maybe it was the big signs saying 'no phones, no cameras' - it may as well have said 'no customers' - or maybe it was the disgruntled barman 'we're not serving food' . Whichever, I didn't feel welcomed.

I got the impression that it's very much a local pub, the same people come here all the time and everyone knows everyone and their son Jock. I came in looking for a drink with my auntie, luckily she was one of afore mentioned locals and so we were embraced...but I get the opinion if I went in hans-solo it would be a different story.What a great name!

This shop is really good if you're into costume jewelery and statement pieces. It's not really my thing, but they have some wonderful things in here.
As Marj C has said, they have really traditional pieces with a modern twist. Their brooches caught my eye, they would absolutely finish off an outfit or a nice jacket. I said to myself I would come back when my student loan comes in.
If you're into statement jewelery and amazing one-off pieces then this is your place. It's something quite special!I've played the violin all my life, and when it came for me to get my own it had to be from stringers. Being a musician, I've found that a lot of other musicians (myself not included) tend to have a fairly high opinion of themselves and there is always an air of superiority when I've looked to buy my own violin from other people.  But not in stringers. The building is beautiful and as soon as you go in you are greeted with that magnificent smell of polished varnish (...ok maybe it's a violin thing). In the main rooms the walls are lined with beautiful violins, cellos, viola's and a couple double bass.  Upstairs is the same but even better...bows and mahogany everywhere. I was quite literally like a kid in a candy shop. I was undecided about which violin I wanted - I had a choice of 3, and whilst I was dithering the staff put the 3 violins away in their cases and just gave them to me for the weekend....they just gave them to me! This gives you an idea of the level of friendliness in this place. There are leaflets everywhere too with details of instructors and concerts as well as leaflets on how to maintain your instrument and how to improve your playing.

I was quite lucky in that my violin was being paid for by the BBC via a bursary, otherwise it would have been well outwith my price range. The prices can start from around £200 up to £20,000! But it's a great place, even if you don't play an instrument, just walk around and smell the varnish!I quite agree with Alice on this one, nothing special here.

It's the sort of shop the kids flock to in their masses before the school disco. Thus everyone wears the same outfits, or a derivative thereof.

I'm glad Alice mentioned the SLUT dresses - I couldn't have put it better myself.

Upon a little bit of research, I found this statement about AB10:

Come on now, you're only lying to yourself.Ok, so it's a Sony shop. But I'm sorry to have to say that it's lost in the modern day world of technology.....we are ruled by Apple now, lets not lie!! So Sony is sort of left outside. It's a shame, because back in the day it was a pretty good electronics shop.

The prices are high though, and it's so easy nowadays to get the same product for half the price. Meh.I am a HUGE fan of Subway, but this particular branch never seems to have all the ingredients!
If they've not run out of all-but-one type of bread, it's lettuce, or it's chicken. I mean come on guys! Help me out here!!
Plus I've always noticed that this particular Subway is used by all the schoolkids in the area, so is always busy and is always messy. There is a brilliant one  mere 10mins walk away - it's worth it!oooooooeeee!!!

This is such an Edinburgh shop. When I was taking a picture for all you yelp fans out there I was accosted by an employee of this fine establishment and asked my purpose and for ID! I've never been asked for ID from a clothes shop in my lift! PAH!

This aside, this shop really does cater for the upper-class Edinburgh socialite. They have some lovely clothes, the quality speaks for itself. (as does the price tag).

The staff are somewhat...erm...stuffy and the general atmosphere of the shop is somewhat pretentious I'm afraid to say.....but they have really good quality items and if you're into that sort of thing then by all means have a dander!It's your bog-standard newspaper shop really. Nobody really loved going to the newsagents, do they? It's pretty good though, lots of food and lots of options for lunch at a pretty reasonable price.

It's clean-ish, and there is always stock waiting to be put away, but it's good nevertheless.They sell sporty stuff, so from the outset I knew this place wasn't for me.

Saying that, the staff were totally lovely. I fell in love with the girl behind the counter, she was so lovely and totally professional. I wanted to buy something, just because she was so nice, so I did! I bought myself a few socks. Yeah, ok, but everyone needs socks. They've served me well!

It's quite a neddy place , as previous yelpers have said, but it's one of the nicer ones.What's the difference between Walt Disney and Bing Crosby? ..

..

Bing sings and Walt dinsae .

BOOM BOOM!!

This Disney shop always looks so inviting, they play music out the door and have moving window displays. When I plucked up the courage to take my 20-year-old self in, I wasn't overly excited, however. They have a great selection of toys and plastic things, the smell of plastic is overwhelming, especially in the pencil case corner. I thought I would go and look for a new pencil case - I used to have a Cinderella one that popped out everywhere if you pressed a specific button, I was so cool. However they didn't seem to stock them anymore...they didn't seem to stock anything exciting like that. 

My memories of the Disney Store were exciting, things flying everywhere and talking toys going off on every aisle, but this time the store was quiet, nothing flying around and no excitement. I was disappointed, but put it down to the fact that I was 20, so I took my ex-boyfriend neice with me, and she felt the same! She didn't enjoy it (despite demanding a hannah montana schoolbag) and said she had been in more exciting ones.I really like Monsoon, they have very classy fashions and brilliant accessories. When I was wee I used to come into this shop and try on all the fancy ball-gown-esque dresses but never buy them, so this shop brings back fond memories!
But I just don't really choose to shop in Monsoon. To me, their clothes are crazily over-priced and their accessories are daylight robbery! But now and again you do find something (like a hair clip) that you are willing to pay £12 for, or a dress you can justify spending £120 on.
It's quite a niche market in a way, very organic and very natural. Some people love that, and I understand why. If you have a fancy event or something special coming up, or just want to have a 'good' outfit,  it's definitely worth a look.The Lane (formally Berlin) was always one of those really 'cool' places that I always felt too intimidated to go to. As I used to work in a nightclub in Edinburgh, I always heard rumours about Berlin - and not too favourable ones. But I actually quite liked it. The music is very indie (well, it was on the night I was there, but I'm told that it changes) and the club itself wasn't too shabby. the staff were brilliant - Richie, the manager, in particular was a great host and you didn't feel like you were in a club. Yeah it was a bit dingy, but nothing that a lick of paint couldn't help.

They have a great night called Diva for all the girls out there, and I thoroughly recommend that too. Drinks were cheap-ish and overall was quite good fun!I was so glad to see that Accessorize survived the recession! It's one of those places that I thought will never disappear...but then I thought that of Woolworths too.

As a kid I loved it in here, whenever I got birthday money or whatever I would come here and pour over all the hair clips - I hadn't discovered my love for shoes yet.

Back then the prices were really cheap, but it's a different story now. Ok the quality has improved ten-fold, but the price is a bit ridiculous sometimes. £12 for a hair pin? Ok it's sparkly but still, no.

The staff here are really friendly too and always happy to help! They always seem to be busy though, so watch out for cramped shop.Now, I'm going to say something a bit controversial here...I really like Starbucks. I like their coffee, I like their cakes and I like their sandwiches. yeh, that's right.

This Starbucks is about 5 minutes from my University library, so I've spent a bit of time here. Although it is really small, it has a nice layout and the decor is that of your typical Starbucks. The staff are really friendly too - they always offer a free taste of one of their cakes or sandwiches. 
Whenever I've been here, I've always found myself lurking for a free table, and when I do the staff practically pounce on me to clear up the remains of the previous occupant. So it's very clean!!

This is definitely one of the better Starbucks I've been in. The main server, Iain, recently won the regional competition for 'flat white' (I didn't know there was competitions for coffee....it's like Glee with caffeine)  so it's good coffee too!I quite like looking around in book shops. There's something satisfying and sophisticated in looking around these places isn't there?
This branch is no exception. Really nice and eerily quiet, it's your bog standard book shop!Now, I might be a bitty biased in my review, I used to work behind the bar during my first year at University. I think this sums it up - first year at University.  When I first started Uni, my brother, being an experienced socialite in Edinburgh, prepared a list for me. A list of clubs and when the best nights to go are, and Why Not features heavily. Naturally, I was curious, and he was not wrong. In freshers week, this small-ish, mysterious club was my playground. Throughout the year I frequently ventured to Why Not, particularly on a Monday or Friday, and have some of the best memories of nights out there. BUT...I realised shortly after going into 2nd year that Why Not is purely for the young'uns.  I realised that those great nights I had in the past were entirely based upon who I was with and who I met, not where I was. It was around this time that I realised how totally horrible Why Not is. Where it was once a great novelty to be in a club with carpet (I know, carpet) , it became a sticky, disgusting mess. As I said, I worked behind the bar for a few months to pay for beer tokens, and the gruesome things I saw were beyond the imagination of Tim Burton.

The club has somewhat of a negative reputation, the place for yah's and socialites to meet other yah's and socialites. Being in first year, you never really notice it, but now it's ridiculous.  I was lucky in that I was always able to get a highly covated place in the VIP room - save your ooh's and aah's please  - basically a room with drinks twice the price and a sofa. A sofa. did you get that?
the queue is always around the corner, if you don't go at 10pm then expect at least a 30minute wait. The drinks deals can be ok, but the alcohol content is always low. And, sorry boys, but Why Not is a thoroughly sexist-biased society - if you're a girl you will get in no matter how drunk you are. If you're a boy and sober, it's 50/50.
SO. All in all, Why Not has given me fond memories yes, but overall it is definitely not somewhere I would go or recommend. Ok, bright-eyed first year students will love it as it is a glorified meet'n'greet but it is not worth the trouble as you get older. A Saturday night in the club is aimed at the older person, and is therefore always dead/ full of old men. The music is very cheesy, with the last song always always always being Lionel Ritchie 'All night long' . If you're into that then great. If not, there are fantastic clubs all along George Street.Whenever I get birthday or Christmas money,  I always choose to spend it in here. They have some lovely things, often you have to search for them but when you find them, it's amazing.
yeah, ok, when you first walk in the floral patterns and fluorescent lace does overwhelm you, but if you go further into the shop and to the lower level you'll find some brilliant things. They model their mannequins particularly well too, I always try on the outfits on display thinking they will look good on me too. They don't.

One of my favourite things about Miss Selfridge is the fact that you can buy something they display in the window and not many people will have it. We've all been there - when in a club or a house party and someone else is wearing the same dress as you, but not if it's a Miss Selfridge dress!
It does get a bad press, but I really like it!Who doesn't love john lewis?! Anything and everything you could possibly ever dream of is under one roof.  Ripped jeans!? Go to the haberdashery section. Empty wall space? Go to the arts section. Hungry? Go to the cafe! It has everything!  The one thing I especially like about this Edinburgh branch is the friendliness of the staff. They will do anything to help you out and the friendly Scottish nature shines through. They always have great cosmetic deals too - especially at clarins. Definitely one of the nicer john lewis' I've been in!You can't hep but be draw to John Lewis. I don't know if it's the size of the place or the reputation, it's always busy!!

The staff are soo so friendly and will do anything to help you. It's such a nice environment, you can't help but be drawn in!!This is such a f'ing cool club.

When you go here (because you will, trust me) make sure you're looking particularly cool. Get rid o that waist-coat and cardigan and don some ripped jeans and a nice tee. They have some amazing nights here, particularly Music Boutique, and rank in some brilliant DJs.

The club itself is really cool, it;s underground so has the whole stone-work arches going on, high ceilings and a lavish upstairs. It's one of my favourite places to go to in Edinburgh  - if I was cool enough  I would be here all the time.I give all charity shops 5*, because their cause is great. The Salvation Army is no exception! The Salvation Army are a great charity, they're brilliant at what they do and so I support them in any way I can. Even if I'm just looking around, I like to come in here to show my support. They are really helpful in here, maybe a bit too helpful. but good nevertheless.

it's your typical charity shop, they sell anything and everything they can and it's all for a good cause.It's a card shop. Does exactly what it says on the tin!!

Apart from cards, they sell balloons, novelty keyrings, novelty cups, toys - pretty much anything celebratory-related, they have it (apart from Champagne...gap in the market, you're welcome Clinton)

Although they are lovely at the time, I often feel hard done by spending £8 on a balloon that is great for the day...but gets tired and dies within the week. I think I would have been better buying  a mug.

this branch is in a good location, it's central so easy to nip in if you're looking for something in particular. Although I agree with Stephanie T, there are nicer places right next door.I must admit, I laughed out loud when I saw Gavin M's comparison to Postman Pat.  Like most 'lol' moments,it's funny cos it's true!!

It's a cute wee corner shop with anything and everytihng....well they don't have light bulbs. They should though.

The staff are beyond lovely and the shop itself is always reasonably clean. It's a great little corner shop.If I ever need a CD or DVD, my first point of contact is Fopp. If they don't have it in stock (which is rare) they order it in for you. The store is on two levels, dvds and select music on the ground floor and dvds on the first floor. They also have a good selection of books, t-shirts and fun things  on the stairs as you walk up - which make it awkward to walk up. If it's busy, Fopp isn't the most enjoyable place to be in, but overall it's a really good music and dvd shop!This is the second of two Armstrong & Son's in Edinburgh, and is definitely not my favourite. It's really quite small and everything is crammed in - if there's more than one person in the shop with you then you may as well leave because there's not much you can do with it!

Their clothes are really decent though - surprisingly! Especially their accessories. I heard a few rumours that all the clothes they sell belong to the now-deceased, but that can't be true....right?

They have some crazy window displays here too. It's quite expensive too!
If you're into this sort of thing then great, if not then keep on walking!Peckham's is the sort of 'shop' where it's totally acceptable to buy a £250 bottle of wine with your freshly made (yet somewhat stale) bread. It is considered to be a high-end supermarket (sortof) and sells itself as serving high-quality and fine-food. Yes, it does sell high-end products - as a student I was always in the ready-meal section and there are no Asda-Price bargains here - but to be honest, it's a rip off. Yes the things they sell are selective and fancy, but taste just as good as similar things you'll get in the corner shop opposite. The ready-made meals are good, but again are on a par with those you'll find in Tesco, a mere 2 minute walk away from this Bruntsfield branch. 
My ex-flatmate used to go down and buy cakes once a week as an indulgence, but after the first few bites would find them too rich and donate to us (thanks Rach!). They have an extensive alcohol section which is alluring, but only to those who appreciate it - aka not me. 
Yes they have nice things and yes their cheeses and cakes look yummy, but is it all really necessary? It's not a bad shop - far from it, it's just a bit pretentious. On those grounds, therefore, it has quite a large market in Edinburgh (ha!) with all the yah's. 
The only time I would frequent Peckham's would have been late at night (it's open till midnight) to buy my dinner -  as a student I'm not the best in the kitchen. Yes the staff are friendly and there is a nice atmosphere, but there is something quite resentful about Peckham's which I can't quite place. The restaurant downstairs is nice......bit dull, but nice. pleasant really. To be totally honest I have been entirely unaffected by Peckham's , which tells me it's not somewhere I will venture to in a  hurry!Coco of Bruntsfield is one of two specialist shops in Bruntsfield, and I'm afraid to report this is the poorer of the two.  The chocolate is delicious - but when is chocolate not delicious  - and the price is a little steep but totally worth it. Word of warning, this is not the place you should go daily to get your 'fix' (I hear ya) as it is proper chocolate, very rich and very intense. They do really great hot chocolates and experiment with different flavours, but if you want to sit down then bring your own seat,

It is a shame that the second chocolatier over-shadows Coco, as it tastes just as good! Unfortunately it comes down to the small things - seats! And to be honest the shop was quite cold! But that's just being picky.Rose street has a handful of hidden gems that not many people know about, and Goodstead is DEFINITELY one of them! It's got really good labels, like Marj C has outlined, and really quirky t-shirts and accessories. Although they are very pricey....you would have to really really love the clothes to buy them!
Saying that, this means the quality is high so you know you're getting a really good product.
The staff are really friendly too, I don't think the shop gets very busy so they are happy to help. It's worth a looky looky.the Assembly Rooms always stood out on George Street for me. The huge pillars and Georgian-style building always intrigued me, especially when the lights were on and you could see a beautiful HUGE chandelier through the windows. The Assembly Rooms is one of the main venues for the Edinburgh Festival, and it's easy to see why. The lavish decor just makes you feel special as soon as you walk in. there are two sweeping staircases with red velvet carpets leading you up to the first floor, where the main hall is. It is classy to the max.

Although I should point out that the festival has an entirely different appearance than what it normally does, but it's lovely nevertheless. the main hall is big and spacious and every seat has a great view of the stage. When the festival comes, I check out Assembly Rooms first, just because it's lovely to be in there. The Downstairs Club bar plays host to all the celebrities when they come to Edinburgh too, so get your camera out!I came in here a little bit bright eyed looking for a present for my dad. He was going skiing the next day and it was his birthday....what's a gal to do?! So I asked a few really friendly sales people and was directed up some stairs to find myself in snow sports heaven. I must have looked as confused as I was, because within a few minutes I was getting help from one of the sales advisors,she was lovely! We managed to pick out things that my Dad would use and he loved them
If I ever go skiing I'm definitely coming here, they are so lovely!The smell wafting out if here is just to die for.  Seriously, you will know what I mean when you sniff it. You wouldn't think you'd recognize the smell of potatoes right?
Inside isn't really much. it's nothing special, but what is special is the potatoes. Gooey, fluffy amazing-ness. Mouth wateringly good. I've been here a few times and sometimes the skin is a bit tough for my liking, but the potato itself is amazing!
they have your standard fillings, mu personal favourite is good ole tuna. It's definitely worth a trip at least onceI totally agree with the other girls - Moleta Munro just screams cool.

They stock everything from fireplaces to decking furniture. Where I would usually swoon over everything in this shop but never be able to afford it, I can confidently go in here knowing that I can afford at least something. A candle holder....or a bike basket. They sell the most extraordinary things! The majority of their stock is, as Marj has said, really ridiculously expensive, but every now and then they have a 25% off sale, or offers in newspapers, so it's worth keeping an eye out.

I am not ashamed to admit it, sometimes I dress up just to go into this shop and look around. I feel cool, so why shouldn't I look it??I agree with Gavin 100%. The staff were a bit nippy but the food makes up for it ten fold. DELICIOUS.

I don't like spice, so I avoided the Chilli, but I loved the falafel and humous. The wrap was so thick and warm and delicious! I'm definitely coming back!!think the star rating says it all - meh, I've experienced better.

Gap used to be one of THE places to shop, back in the day. Remember everyone used to have the hoody's? What's happened Gap? Their clothes have moved from fashionable tops to staple items. If I need  a good quality white t-shirt I'll come here, no questions asked, and I'll get good stuff! But I wouldn't come here if I was looking for something to hit the town in.

Although they have changed their wardrobe, they have really good children's stuff and good denim jeans and lovely denim dresses, but nothing absolutely ground-breaking.Ok, the buildings are horrible...well, David Hume and Appleton are, but lets not forget the beautiful Teviot and McEwan Hall! As well as Reid Hall, Drummond Street, High School Yards...I could go on.
The University itself is great...but I suppose I have to say that because I study here!
Even if I didn't though, I would be full of praise for the University. They are extremely professional and very modern with their technologies and operating systems. It's almost intimidating how up-to-date it is.

My favourite part is George Square. It's a lovely area in the summer and is absolutely beautiful in winter. 

Edinburgh University does have a bit of a reputation for being full of 'yahs' .... which is true, but to be honest they stick together, so unless you're one of them they won't cross your path!I think White  Stuff is getting a bit of  a bad name...! Ok, so all the stuff isn't white, but a little white lie doesn't hurt! (...see what I did there?)

It's quite good for what it is....come on now, don't lie!! We all need flip flops at some point, and ok some people are more into this lifestyle than others, but it's a pretty cool one nevertheless!!My brothers were obsessed with roller blading. They've moved onto snowboarding you'll be glad to know, but it meant that a lot of my youth was spent in here. 
This is your typical skateboard shop. Full of Japanese names and baggy jeans, if you're going through puberty / never really grew up this is your place.H&M is my guilty pleasure. I don't feel guilty when I'm in there, but I always feel guilty leaving because I've spent a fortune.
I can't help it!
They have the BEST staple items you could possible want. Gok Wan, move aside - the capsule wardrobe comes straight from H&M.

The funny thing is there are 2 H&Ms on Princes Street. This isn't my favourite, but it's good nevertheless. 

I bought 2 skirts here the other day, £2 each! One black and one grey. They're not particularly fancy but they are brilliant value.

H&M stands for Hot and Mine, i'm telling youThis. place. is. amazing.

If my punctuation hasn't emphasized this enough, allow me to continue...

This shop just SCREAMS classy. From the outset  - the old victorian-style  building just looks chic. The gorgeous dresses in the window are amazing, they just know style in here. I'm single, yet even I'm tempted to do a 'Murials Wedding' and come in here...

Imagine my face when I was told that one of my mums best friends was getting married, and I was allowed to come alone with them to Caroline Castigliano.....I nearly wet myself

The place was just as amazing as I could have hoped for. The staff were amazing, the dressing area was divine.

if you're getting married, you NEED to come here. Seriously. It's a must.

Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and something from CAroline CastiglianoComic books and pop art are right up my street! Dead head is right up my street!!

It has the best selection of magazines and comics ever. It's totally quirky and really cool, and still quite grounded!!

It's the sort of place I could just spend hours and hours in, flicking through the pages and thinking about the colours. I often browse in here, always pushing my luck as to how long is acceptable without buying!This branch of French Connection is as good as it gets. The staff are really friendly - there is always someone at the door to greet you, no matter how busy it is, which I think is a nice touch.

All their clothes are presented in a really manageable way and if you need anything then they are pouring over themselves to help -  one of the assistants helped me fix my bag once. The ground floor has all the womenswear and the first floor is the mens. The only thing that might put people off this particular branch is the fact that the downstairs fitting rooms are communal, so if you don't mind stripping off infront of strangers then it's fine. Otherwise there's a bigger changing room upstairs, complete with lockable doors.Whenever I would walk past Inca, there would always be a good atmosphere and almost always busy. It was only natural that I paid it a visit, to see what all the fuss was about. From the outside, the Italian mosaic-style writing is really quaint and lures you in, but I did not appreciate the harsh tiles on the inside, and I don't know which 'mood' the lighting was going for, but it was near impossible to see my friends, let alone my food. When we asked for a candle, we were told that there were problems with the electricity, so probably shouldn't have an open flame. This made us want to stay...

The food was ok. Average, nothing special. I'm a traditionalist, so opted for the Carbonara (surprise surprise) and it was quite tasteless. To be honest, it wasn't worth the calories. My friend said she saw something black scutter across the floor at one point. The restaurant seemed clean enough and everything was laid out well, but there was something not quite right.

I'm a bit hesitant to report of my bad experience in Inca as it is always so busy, so must attract custom from somewhere. There must be an amazing dish that I haven't heard about, or something I'm missing. When I find it, Ill let you know. Until then, stay clear.I only go into this mall for thee places - Joy, Kookai and Xile. To be honest, I'm scared when I go in here. I don't like to stereotype, but whenever I go in all I see is young people, big earrings, hoody's and sometimes prams. I don't think it's the best image for people just arriving to the city.

When I came through the food court just this afternoon to use the bathrooms, I was stared at, pointed at and spoken about. aah!!

Although the mall does have a reasonably good selection of shops - Warehouse, New Look, ...um.... 
I would only go in here to go to shops that are alone in the city - Xile, Kookai and Joy are the only 3 in the area.

Sometimes they have really cool exhibitions..sortof...such as funny road-signs, cool displays and posters. Overall, it's a bit of an odd combination of 60s gentrification and the recession!I was a bit confused when I saw this place, I was confused as to why I had never really noticed it before and about their collection of clothes...so I went in!
The shop itself is quite small, and I was greeted by a nice man! But I felt a bit under pressure to spend a few minutes looking, I was being watched! The bottom half of the shop is for women and the rest is for men, to be honest it's mainly aimed at men, there is a far bigger selection. 
They sell the likes of Miss Sixty etc, some of the things are really lovely but some are a bit out there. It's quite expensive too. But hey, go have a look, there might be something to take your fancyI don't like Sushi, so I was doomed from the minute I walked through the door here.

I asked the waiter what is the best thing to have for a first-time sushi experience,... he laughed in my face and told me I was in the wrong place. How rude!!

My brothers loved the sushi, they actually like it, I hated it. I left feeling hungry and cheated. It's a nice place, but just not my cup of tea.MMmmmmm you really can smell this shop for miles, can't you! It's quite funny when you think about it. A shop that specializes in bath salts, soaps and shower gels! But my god what a selection. There is so much more to Lush than just a sweet, sweet smell. They have anything you could want (...soap-wise).

I always feel really cool choosing a soap, getting it cut for me and taking it home in a little brown paper bag! It's a bit odd, I'll admit, but it's the little things that float my boat.

Their bombs are brilliant  - but I'd recommend you don't get one with little bits (such as flower petals) in them because you'll be finding them in your knooks and crannies for days after, and they begin to itch abit in the bath.

My favourite thing about Lush is their chocolate lip-balm. Not only is it delicious, but it's a brilliant balm! It's as good as any nivea or carex, and tastes and smells of chocolate. At £6 it will last you the whole year (depending on your chocolate consumption...it could be 6 days)I was quite lucky in that I lived opposite Cafe Grande last year, but I was not so lucky as I didn't even know it was there! When I finally made it into the cafe it was towards the end of my time in Bruntsfield, I wish I had known about it sooner.

The menu is great! Every option is mouth-watering and yummy. Their paninis are great, the bread they use always tastes fresh and tastes healthy (even if dripping in cheese). My brother said his chicken Balmoral was a bit dry, but the cheesecake was amazing.

Furthermore, they have live jazz every weekend. They have a big board with all the details of their sessions and they are always busy. It's a great wee cafe!I love post offices. Is that weird? Seriously, they're so useful. This place is no exception, you can do anything you want in here (well, postal-related). The staff are absolutely lovely too, super friendly and wish me a nice day every time I leave. It's the small things.My brother is somewhat of a shoe-fanatic (and he's straight! if he wasn't my brother i'd be married to him). Thus, we always go into this type of shoe store. It's quite trendy, and all the staff have hats on and slumped jeans (so you just know it's cool). 
However I really wasn't too impressed with it. Yeah they have a great selection of trainers etc , but i think it's a niche market that was wasted on lil ole me.

The ironic thing is, Matty, my bro, wasn't impressed either. This sort of shoe shop is aimed at people like Matthew but it passed him by.
I think it's trying to be something it's not  - being on Multrees Walk gives it a bit of a stigma, which it is trying but failing to live up to.I love Scoosh!

If the quirky exterior doesn't entice you in, then the colourful displays will. They have the coolest umbrella's in Edinburgh! I always get complimented on my scoosh brolly, I love it when it rains.

They do really nice small things, ideal for quirky stocking-fillers. They also have a specialist jeweler who makes really different bracelets and necklaces with odd bits and bobs, but were a bit pricey - about £30-£50 for a bracelet. They sell really cool cards - if I have an important birthday coming up I would always go to Scoosh to get it.

All in all, it's just a really nice shop in a lovely area. I love wandering around places like Scoosh!Cruise is lovely.

Whenever my brothers are in the city I always make sure I accompany them to Cruise. Yeah, it's a unisex shop but is aimed mainly at men, so I feel like a bit of a creep going in here alone. The clothes they sell are ultra high-end and ultra-expensive, but they are amazing. When I get my first proper 9-5 job, I plan to buy my power suit form here. The husband and 2.3 children will come later, I presume.

They are a smaller version of Harvey Nichols for their brands and prices, but it's quite nice to feel posh, even if it's just for a few minutes!There are a few really cute, quirky shops in Bruntsfield, and Miam Miam leads them all. It's a really cute shop, selling really cool little bits and bobs and some furniture. It's the sort of place you can happily browse and smile at all the things they sell - because that's the most accurate description I can provide - it's just things!
Yeah, it's a really nice shop and the staff are lovely! But I begin to question my sanity when I'm considering buying a £25 pink polka-dot tea cosy when a) I don't drink tea and b) I don't have a tea-pot. Some of their stock does raise a few eyebrows, but hey, it's fun I suppose. I've always said I would go back for Christmas shopping or for a birthday, but I always forget.I kind of have to agree with the general uncool vibe coming from fellow yelpers about Barratts - but there's nothing wrong with their shoes!! I used to quite like coming here to get my school shoes, figure out what trend i would be setting (take note - setting, not following ;) ). I once got the coolest pair of little Alice black pumps and I wore them with white socks - I was the coolest kid in town.

Unlike most other high street shoe shops, a pair of Barratt Shoes will last you a lifetime. No holes or flapping soles here thank you very much. And all for a really reasonable price!It's nice to see a shop exclusively for men on the high street that doesn't only sell suits!
Burton fills a gap in the market for those too proud to go to Topman or too poor to go to Cruise. It's bang on!

the prices are pretty decent for what they sell, and the stuff is always on trend and pretty fashionable really. The staff are always really happy to help and really grounded, refreshigly so!

Plus if you're a student, it's 10% off! woohooThis is the supplier of most Edinburgh University course books. As such, it's always teaming with students and is extortionately over-priced. I regularly have to come in here to get books and spend well over £100 and leave with 2 or 3 books. What's up with that?!

It's joined onto Cafe Nero, so the aroma of coffee wafting up is a pleasant experience. They also have great stuff on the first floor, magazines, calendars, quirky books and beautiful presents. They sell really nice things but you have to pay through the teeth for them.
It's a good place if you're in a hurry, but if not then I suggest you wander through all the charity shops first, they probably have the books you need!Alternative? Ok. I just call it odd.

It's not my thing, but I can see why it appeals to others. Not for me though.

staff are lovely! When I came in i was greeted warmly and felt at ease. The prices looked reasonable, but again, not for me.I feel a bit funny reviewing a GP surgery, but I can't ignore Bruntsfield Medical Practice. I registered here as a temporary resident as a student living in the area, and it wasn't long before I made the move permanent. The receptionists are very welcoming and the medical staff are nothing short of excellent. It is not often that you feel comfortable talking about personal issues with a doctor, but they put you at ease straight away. No matter how silly or embarrassing, I felt completely at ease talking to my doctor here. 

The only fault of the practice is the time-keeping, on numerous occasions I found myself waiting for longer than 30 minutes past my appointment time. However, I realised why upon spending a good 15 minutes with my doctor. They go above and beyond to spend time and just chat, it's really worth looking into.This is a lovely little cafe in Marchmont. i think that's doing it justice.

I came here with a few friends and was not met by the most pleasant atmosphere. We were causing problems by moving seats around (there was 6 of us) and the displeasure could not have been made more clear. When we eventually sat down, all my friends ordered bacon rolls while I went for the Minestroni Soup. Bad choice. It was tasteless, watery and somehow rubbery, whilst my friends said their bacon rolls were amazing. But you can't really get them wrong, right?!
When we came to pay there was a bit of trouble with splitting the bill, but we managed to sort it out amongst ourselves as the waitress was being really awkward with it.
It wasn't the best experience, but I would go back to give it another chance.This Marks and Sparks feeds the masses.

It's right in the middle of Princes Street so whenever the power-suits or baggy-briefed alike need their lunch, they come here. It's convenient and the food is good - why not! I can highly, highly recommend their sweet chilli prawns. I'm salivating at the thought.

However, it's a bit of a victim of its own success. If you hit it at the wrong time, everything is gone, or if you hit it at the right time then you have to queue for about 10 minutes. I've seen myself eating my lunch in the queue and giving the cashier an empty wrapper to charge me.

Their food is brilliant though, you can't deny it.I think shops like these are brilliant! I fully salute all charity shops - it's completely guilt-free shopping!
Ok so their stock isn't exactly brilliant, but it's not bad. They have quite a selection though, it's worth coming in here just for a look around, chances are you'll see something you like or need. 
The staff are really lovely too, they are happy to help and happy just to chat.
It's so worthwhile coming in here, it's all for a good cause. So next time you need something, come in here first!This place is my haven!!

I fell in love with a grey jacket here once, it was stunning. It had red lining and the inside had a red and white racehorse pattern on it. it's so quirky. When my dad came in here randomly a few weeks later, the staff told him that a girl fitting my description fell in love with this coat and gave it to him for a discounted price! Talk about service!!

They have really quirky things in here, really cool and really wonderful!! Ok it's quite expensive, but look at all the pretty things. Isn't it worth it?! My jacket certainly is! I've had so many compliments on it, and people seem to know it's totty rocks because of the distinctive style.

I can't emphasize enough how much I love it here - please please visit!Here's a friendly fact for you - my brother helped to build this store!! Desperate student promised £1000 for 1 weeks work.....of course it didn't follow through. Nevermind.

Morrisons is sort of considered to be at the higher end of supermarket chains. Kinda. The adverts are really cool, although I can never get that Take-That song out of my head after they're on. And now neither can you.

The food they sell is of high quality, and the meat, cheese and deli counters are really good. They obviously know their stuff in here, they know the difference between Chedder and Mature Chedder.I hear this is where JK Rowing wrote Harry Potter.

Famous history aside, this place is actually pretty cool. It's quite chic in its own little way. It's always busy due to afore mentioned claim to fame, but it's always really lovely too. If you're lucky enough to get a seat then stick with it until the doors are closing. Only once have I managed to get a seat and sat there for hours - it was brilliant.

It's definitely the sort of place to bring your brothers and sisters and mums and dads to show them Edinburgh. it's lovely.Ripping Records always has the latest tickets to all the cool things in the city - gigs, concerts and club nights especially. As such there is always a constant stream of people in this shop, so it's always busy. 
They have all sorts of music, but mainly mainstream and indie/edgy. It's all moderately priced too, cheaper than most other bigger shops. The staff are really nice, and really cool. I never feel cool enough to be in here, I'll take my Michael Buble and leave.Bar - expensive

Staff - judging

Location - alright

Decor - good

wine -warm

Toilets - BAD BAD BADWhen I went into Fraser Heart to get my friend a 21st present, I thought it was quite normal to ask for help and advice about what to buy. But I was greeted with a disgruntled 'I'll be with you in a minute' and ignored for about 20 minutes! I managed to find something by myself, but it took a further 10 minutes to organize the order and get my details down. I left feeling a bit disappointed with my visit, but hey everyone has bad days - right? 
When I went back to collect said same present I was greeted with the same I-can't-be-bothered dismissal (by a different member of staff) and once again I left feeling really disappointed with the service I received. Ok, I understand that everyone has bad days, but it wasn't just one person and it was on more than one occasion. When I mentioned this to a friend they said they felt the same. I love shopping, and I love chatting to the employees to get their opinion, but I was totally alone in this decision. Their jewelry is nice, your bog-standard sets, and to be honest I'm not planning on returning.Ok, so I was a bit mean to start with.

The staff were extremely rude, yes, but let's look past that. The jewelery they sell is  lovely, you can't really hate everything in this store. They stock Thomas Sabo, Calvin Klein, Hot Diamonds, Raymond Veil and so much more. You can't help but browse, especially since it's located on one of the best spots on Princes Street.

Ok,it's alright...I s'pose.........WOW!

I lived in Bruntsfield for a year and definitely didn't know there was such an amazing ice cream parlour a few minutes away! When I found it I was in shock! It is like something out of an American sitcom. 
They have all the flavours in the world, as well as lots of confectionary goodness. Although it is very pricey - I came on a date here once and was bought a little gold chocolate bunny, for £3! It was smaller than my thumb, so although I appreciated the gesture it was a bit OTT....

Upstairs is a cafe-style area to eat your ice cream if you want to sit in with it. It's all very quaint!all I can say is WOW

You need to come here, seriously, it's amazing.

Yolanda, the owner, is nothing short of brilliant. So creative, so meticulous with her presentation, so fun and energetic, so lovely and so nice!! She is so professional and it shoes in her parlours.

eleven out of ten!!As a student living alone, I get take-aways regularly. Then I get annoyed because my bum isn't getting any smaller. Probably something to do with the take-aways that I don't stop eating until a)It's finished and b) i feel sick.

But Noor seem to have the solution! Their portions are quite small - perfect for one person! When I first got food from here (Chicken Korma, really creamy and delicious) I was kind of disappointed by what seemed like little amount of food I was given, but turns out it was perfect!!

They have a really extensive menu, it all looks delicious. I'm a spice pussy though, so I don't tend to go for the spice, but I'm told it's really good too!

They deliver too, which is great. They are even part of just-eat.co.uk so you don't even have to pick up the phone, order online!

I really like Noor!I've been in here a few times, each time deciding that this time I'll do what they tell me to and I'll feel like Superwoman. I still haven't!!

Basically it's a health food shop. Kinda. They sell the likes of cod liver oil tablets and garlic capsules etc etc, the staff are WONDERFUL. Can'tt fault them on that!! I went in on day hearing that if I took a spoonful of Manuka Honey at bed time it helps your skin and makes you lose weight, and it did! I was glowing. Ok it wasn't like a heap of weight, but enough to make me feel better about myself. The staff gave me the honey and some cider vinegar to cook with, they knew all their stuff....but it cost me over £40!! Hence the missing 2*.

If you're serious about this sort of stuff then this is a great place. If not, then go to Boots.Meh! Whoever can wear something from All Saints and pull it off is a better person than me! I can't understand the ruffles, the layers and the belts......a girl wants to look smaller, right?  But the All Saints stuff adds layers to the hips and shows boobs. Hmm..!!

I found the staff in here to be a bit pretentious if I'm being honest....I got the whole head-to-toe look when I went in today, and I'm pretty sure they were talking about my outfit. As well as being just plain odd, the price tag is extortionate.

Although I have seen a few nice things in here, and bought myself a lovely jacket once, I think it's a hit or a missI had never really heard of Lime Blue until I was given a beautiful necklace for Christmas.  The necklace was really different and unusual, so I went into the shop just to see what they have. They have a lovely selection of really different, quirky jewellery and have a modern twist on a modern piece. Saying that, their jewellery isn't garish or over the top, it's understated and really simple. I can't really say it has a particular style, because its style is brand new. They don't follow the trend, they set it, man.
Their prices are a bit on the pricey side, but with each piece you get a huge elaborate box and a cloth, so you're paying around  10% for the packaging. Take that, mother nature!I'm a bit of a sucker when it comes to bargains. Hey, I'm only human.

Sally's provides just that. If I have a big event coming up, I come here for the DIY nails, body lotions, face-masks and hair-masks. They sell them in bulk too, so it lasts a long, long time. I still have a mud mask I bought 4 years ago.

They have a great selection of fake nails and tans, so you can take your pic. I prefer to come here over Boots or any of the big boys, because I trust the quality in Sally's so I know it will be a good product. 
I thoroughly recommend said same mud mask and their moisturizing face masks, they really work and last forever!!There's something about Swatch that just makes it stand out above the rest. The quality is brilliant, it speaks for itself. I've had 3 Swatch watches so far during my time on this planet, and I'm proud to report that every single one is still ticking nicely in my drawer.

They release new lines every summer, and some they release more often. They are always spot-on with their styles and patterns, and always for an amazing price!

Daylight robbery? I think so!

The staff are nice enough, but to be honest there's not much they can do to make Swatch any better!I don't know about you, but that damn theme tune is in my head now. PC WORLD!! you know the one.

Well you can't really go wrong with it can you? It's a world of PCs. But now it's branched out...I bought a rather good TV here the other day. Wayhey, good for you PC world.

the staff are pretty dull in here though, it must be said. You get your token store manager who is enthusiastic about everything, a-la-Ricky Gervais' Office persona, but still. It's nice to see that 60s mantra is still going strong!!

For all your PC needs, it's PC WORLD!! (...that damn tune)I've been waiting to review Monteiths. I love it so much I decided to go back one more time, to experience the whole thing again so it's fresh in my mind.

I love Monteiths. It's often described in tourist guides as 'Edinburgh's best kept secret' and it's not wrong! It is sitting just off the Royal Mile and can easily be missed if you don't know where it is. The fairy-lit walkway doesn't seem like much, and the steps down to the restaurant may seem a bit odd at first, but once you're down there, you're never going to want to leave. 

The bar is tres chic! Very cool and all the furniture is quirky, different and kitsch. They have a very special Banksy on the wall (google him!) of Edinburgh and really cool other features - such as a plastic deer-head and a mini library!

But let's get to the good stuff. The food...ok, I hear the point that the portions are small but the food is good. After all, it's quality not quantity! It's proper good, fancy food and tastes as expensive as it is...!  My only criticism would be about the desserts - nothing mouth-watering but hey, a moment on the lips and all that. So maybe it's for the best!

Monteiths is the sort of place I would take someone visiting Edinburgh for the first time. It's a really special place, in the summertime the beer garden is beautiful - I'm having my 21st here! It's a very special place!This place is brilliant, nothing more to say.

Well, ok I'll go on....

It doesn't look like much to people walking past and you'll not be the first to walk past it, but if you go in you'll never want to go anywhere else!! 

The offer huge dishes for next to nothing! The food is delicious and the people there are beyond wonderful.

It feels like you're getting a cuddle every time you're in here, it's a total diamond in the rough! Only tell your best friends!I totally agree with everything everyone has said here, it's so easy to get lost in here! i mean a club/bar on 3 floors?? What;s that all about?

This place has sort of jumped into the limelight in societies and groups of people taking on the Espoinage challenge - a drink at the bar on every floor and first one outside at the top wins. It takes about an hour because you can never get served, but I head the record is 32 minutes. Impressive.

Seriously though, it's sticky, it's grotty and it's smelly. But it;'s cheap. And that'll do me nicely.One of the biggest and the best tourist attractions in Edinburgh has to be the castle. If you visit Edinburgh, you visit the castle - it's standard. But it's not just tourists who enjoy this historic landmark; I love it too! Ok I don't go every week or anything, but whenever I get a chance every other month or so, I pay a visit. It's a really unique thing to the city to have such a beautiful castle right in the middle of it. It's quite expensive to get in  - hence the missing star - but it is worth it if you're interested in the history aspects. I never go in, I hang around and take in the sights. Some of the best views of Edinburgh can be seen from the top of the Royal Mile, so head on up just for that!Standing tall above the city, the Walter Scott Monument is one of the main touristy things to do on Princes Street. Although it looks dirty, the architecture is breath-taking. The dark stuff on it is oil - if you're interested (I learnt that from a bus tour!).
To save you about 10 minutes circling the building, the door is round the back of the monument. You're welcome.

When you're in you have to climb quite a big set of stairs to get to the top.  If you're claustrophobic then maybe it's not for you, because the stairs are windy and narrow. When you get to the top though it's well worth the trip. Some of the best views of the city are found up here.
Definitely worth a visit.yeah Toast is really brilliant - read the reviews below this to see that it really is a diamond in the rough in Marchmont. But lets not ignore the price!! It's ridiculously overpriced and costs a arm and a leg for the cheapest things!
When I came here I ordered a hot chocolate - costing me £4.20 to do so, and my friends sandwich cost a whopping £5.60! The sandwich wasn't anything special, we could have popped next door to Scotmid and made it ourselves.
I think I'll have to give Toast a second chance, its first impression wasn't a great one.I stand corrected! Upon coming here only yesterday with my friend we had quite a nice lunch! The sandwiches were really delicious - I had the sweet chilli prawns and my friend had the pepper and mozzarella. As per usual, we both wished we had ordered what the other had so we swapped half way through. Really yummy! 
The hot chocolate was only £2.20 this time, and the staff were absolutely lovely!!  

I haven't been here for dinner yet but my friends tell me it's brilliant, with real foodie-food, if you know what I mean! Rest assured I will though!
Toast, I judged you too soon!My first visit to Dragonfly was brilliant - I was really impressed with the personalized waiter-service and their genuine interest in giving you the best drink. I was quite young (but over 18, folks) when I first visited Dragonfly, and so ordered a sickly sweet pink concoction with hundreds and thousands around the rim - I was lured in. My mum played it safe with a French Martini (which was to die for) and my brother had a slightly more masculine Beer. The second time I visited I was slightly less impressed, it seemed a bit run-down and tired looking. But the decor is really trendy and modern. They used to have a wall full of sneakers - one of those really cool things to be interested in - and captured the geek chic concept well. I love Dragonfly, and make sure to go whenever I can.Edinburgh students are quite lucky to have two unions practically opposite each other, but to be honest it would be just fine if it was only Teviot. It has a great charm to it, looking like it has come straight out of Harry Potter and still has a magical atmosphere.

I recently took a friend into the union for some lunch and she couldn't stop talking about the building and the layout. The library bar is covered in vintage books and board games and really looks the part. I think I heard somewhere that it is one of the oldest unions in the UK and it looks good for it! It is rammed with history.

The menu is great, and dirt cheap!! They do great burgers and even better main meals. Even the sandwiches are yummy!

So, if you're a student looking for a great, quick bite to eat or wandering around the city looking for somewhere nice to dine, head to Teviot. It's worth it.This is one of my favourite places to be in Edinburgh when it's a nice day. Even if it's not a particularly sunny day, I still love strolling through the gardens. I always cut through from market street to the galleries in the Garden as it cuts back foot-traffic and it's just a nice place to be!

However, there has been more than one occasion where I've felt intimidated by large groups of teenagers experimenting with their eye-liner and hair-dye. They all seem to hang around the gates so it looks frightening when you're walking in...but within 2 minutes you can't even hear them and you're left in peaceful bliss! It's so easy to forget that you're in the centre of Scotland's capital, it is so beautiful. If I'm out shopping on Princes St I always grab a sandwich and eat on one of the benches in the Gardens. It's lovely!This is your typical Royal Mile pub..ish. It's a great location, and so tourists always find their way in here, but it's a good place to find your way into! It's a nice, friendly pub with good service and good food! I took my vegetarian friend here once for the vegetarian haggis, and I think I preferred it to the real one!

But, with every good thing there has to be a catch. And there is...A few years ago there was a murder right outside The World's End, and as a result there have been countless ghost stories about what happened and the lingering spirit. I don't know about you, but that sort of stuff does spook me a wee bitty...Ok, so Edinburgh is more or less renowned for having posh students (yah's, for those in the know) and Harvey Nichols is their playground. Even the staff have hair to envy Winehouse. But you know what...there is something quite nice about watching them run around after me. The things sold in Harvey Nichols are very high-end, but if you have a big event coming up then it's worth splurging sometimes.

When it comes to Harvey Nichols, I have a routine. When my mum comes down to Edinburgh for a visit, we ALWAYS make an appointment at the champagne nail bar on the ground floor, before heading up to the 4th floor to drink French Martini's until it's time for dinner. Bliss! Infact, I consider myself to be somewhat of a French Martini connoisseur, and Harvey Nicks is the best in Edinburgh! Absolutely delicious. My mum and I are regulars - we are even in the brochure. Not even kidding.

All in all, I could spend all day in Harvey Nichols. There's something quite exciting about getting all dressed up to go shopping and spoil yourself. It's not just a shop, it's an experience!WOW

This place delivers. They make the most delicious cupcakes I've ever had the pleasure of eating, so soft and moist in the centre yet really cakey. If that makes sense?!

They have amazing frosting (which tastes amazing) and patterns, they go all out for whatever you want. Cupcakes!! Brilliant!!!

I definitely know who i'm calling when i'm having a partyThis bar fits in nicely in the Grassmarket - it's a hot spot for stag and hen parties and is always crammed with various pub golf pub crawls, fancy dress nights out etc etc. The prices are really good and you can quite happily spend the whole day/whole night here without breaking the bank.

It's really nice to sit outside here in the summer with a cider and watch the world go by. When it's busy, it's not the best place to be because you're constantly fighting to get anywhere, but it's got a good atmosphere.I'm not really into sports - you would know that if you ever saw my hips - but Sportsters is a playground for those who are. I've been here for a few big events, most recently the Superbowl. It has a great atmosphere and is always busy if there's a big event on.
I went with my ex boyfriend and his football team, so we got in free but they were charging £7 at the door - crazy!!
Whenever there is a sporting event everyone gets really into it here. And during the breaks, there is a playstation at each table - cool!! One of the good things about Sportsters is they have small screens on each table, so when you can't see the big screen properly you have your own personal one!

Their food is ok too - we had nachos and there were a bit scarce with the cheese (the best bit in my opinion...maybe that explains the hips)Tigerlilly. AKA if you're in here you're instantly cool. Should that be the concept of a restaurant?? I don't think so...

the fact that Tiger Lilly is now more of a 'oh my God, look what she's wearing' rather that 'oh my God this tastes great' says it all. Tiger Lilly is crying potential but it's never quite met because they are trying too hard to be cool....trendy.....awesome and whatever else the kids say these days. Ok, so the food is okay...nothing special. I've had better salad leaves with vinegar. (incase you didn't get that, I'm trying to say they are small in portion sizes and not very substantial). 
Although...if you are looking for somewhere to go for a drink, Tiger Lilly is the place. It is very nice, you can't deny that. Infact, I used the wallpaper for my bedroom. It's the sort of place you go if you wear a suit and will have 2.3 children. At 5pm it's full of suits and at 11pm you can't see past the back-combed bouffant parade (aka students) but it's quite nice to have a loud, busy atmosphere sometimes. Sometimes it's good to feel cool and 'hip'. The food isn't amazing, but it's ok. ridiculously over-priced too. But hey, you can't put a price on social status. Also, the fact that my 50 year old mother goes there to pick up guys says it all...Ok. I was harsh before. I come in here quite a lot and really like it every time. It's a cool place, really trendy and good to come if it's your first time in the city and looking for somewhere to go and people-watch.
It's decorated nicely and the staff are friendly. Ok, it's a bit poser-ish, but it's good nevertheless!Before you read on, you should probably know I don't like fudge...

The fudge kitchen's reputation preceeds the actual place! Whenever I tell someone I live in Edinburgh, they almost always ask about the fudge kitchen. And I understand why - it's sitting on the Royal Mile and the smell wafts up the street all day long. As I said, I don't like fudge, but I do like smelling it. What's wrong with that? My brothers love fudge, and always go in to get one of their free samples.
yes, free samples! They always have a sample on the counter of one of their specialities. Although use caution when going to get some - my brother got caught out. Mortified isn't the word.

One of the things I quite like about the fudge kitchen is the people - they literally drag you into the shop because they know that once you're in, you won't want to leave. But when I say drag, I mean it in the nicest way possible - they are really friendly and funny! During the festival they join the acts on the street and get tourists in.

Unfortunately, it didn't float my boat. But it's a great way to experience Scottish tradition and load up on energy to climb all the hills in EdinburghAhh.....fond memories!! 

Stereo kind of gets a bad reputation for being a bit skanky and a bit undesirable, but it's great!! It's a really big club, and in my experience it's never really busy so if you're looking for somewhere with a large group of mates to just have some fun then this is your place!!

My best night ever out in Edinburgh took place in Stereo. It was one of the Shag-tag nights (lovingly known as date-rape night). Yeah the idea behind it is really quite disgusting, but if the right people are there then it's not so bad....kinda. It's all about the people, not the place!

The club itself isn't too bad - it can be a bit sticky but it's clean otherwise. The toilets and spotless and you can't fault the bar!

If you have a big group, this is your placeEvery single review of the festival has had 5 *. Enough said

Well....I may as well say some more....

I worked in the festival last year, and it was AMAZING. I had only ever visited the fesitval as a tourist so I was fully expecting to hate it and resent everything about it as I was having to work 12 hour shifts 6 days a week. No, it made me love it more.
The people in the city are amazing. I've lived here on and off for more than 10 years and I felt like a tourist. It is like an entire new city. It's like Atlantis...only real!!

The shows they have are amazing, there's no other way of saying it. The Meadows are spectacular, the gardens are filled and everyone is happy! I worked in The Assembly Rooms on George Street and it was so much fun. I met so many lovely people and celebrities. 

There's nothing more I can say as it's all been said before me. Come to the festival 2010 - trust me on this one.I have walked past this place more times than I care to remember and been in for their £6 lunch buffets a few times. Every time I'm left a little less satisfied than when I went in........hungry, no... but still wanting more.
The food is what you would expect from a place like this, curries of all shapes and spices and a lot of vegeterian dishes. I struggled to explore anything past a Tikka - i'm a spice pussy.
the value is very good but there's just not that spark!I've read about this restaurant many times in City Guides and recommendations about Edinburgh. It's a lovely restaurant, the first thing that struck me though was the dark lighting. I can see what they were going for - the mysterious dark look, but it was too dark! I struggled to navigate my way around the restaurant and had to use the candle to read the menu!
The food was delicious, very 'foody' (for the use of a better word) and tasty. I can highly recommend the fishcakes, they were the best I've ever tasted!Again, still very good, but they never took my lighting suggestions on board!! what's up with that?!

the food still is amazing though, you cant deny thatThis was the first bar I ever went into as a fresher in University. As such, it holds somewhat of a special place in my heart....but I think that's just me. When I told my brothers that I liked Doctors, they shunned and mocked me. Apparently it's the breeding ground for all the medics on the prowl. As much as I quite fancy myself marrying a doctor (Patrick Dempsey please) I don't think I'm ready to pick one up in the pub....a sleazy pub at that.

The staff were reasonably nice when I was there....not overwhelmingly so. My friends were asked to be quiet (even though it was a busy Friday night) and I was asked to move! The prices were reasonably good, and the selection was your standard bar plus a few colourful shots (for the easily-led students).I never knew I was into coffee, until I tasted a cup from here. Wow. It's a victim of its own success for me though, once I've had a cup I don't want anything else.

The atmosphere is really relaxed and really comfortable. Although there aren't many places to sit, it's nice to just walk around and chill out.

It's definitely worth a look.As has been said before me, this is just a typical MacDonald's restaurant but it's quite a good one! It has a really big seating area upstairs and plenty room for the masses. 

However, past 10pm this place can be dangerous. I have often felt really intimidates by all the teenagers hanging around and later on, all the drunks. 

It's a good enough place for lunch or an early dinner but I wouldn't come here later than 11pm!This branch opened the same day I moved into my flat in Bruntsfield, and so I thought it was fate telling me that I had to eat here as often as I could. And I did.

I really like this branch as all the staff are super friendly. They ask how your day is going while you wait, and they offer you extra things for a discount. I thought it might have just been for my benefit, but they asked every single person who came in. Nice touch.

The difference between this branch and most other Baguette Express' is the seats - there are some! There is quite a big area to stand in, so you don't feel crammed in and there's plenty room to sit and eat in the window if you like. I always have coronation chicken with brie - sounds odd I know, but tastes amazing.Ok so I came back here the other day, for nostalgia more than anything, and I realised that the seats are more of a novelty than anything else. Don't get my wrong, I LOVE Baguette Express, but it's always so busy and you must save about 15 minutes for queuing, particularly in this branch!!This is one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh if I'm heading out last-minute. It always gaurantee's quality and the food is delicious! And you don't have to be particularly dressy either - amazing!

My first visit here was with my dad, after we had just climbed Arthurs Seat (imagine sweat marks, curly hair and muddy shoes) but I didn't feel uncomfortable. Partly because it had a really casual atmosphere, and partly because it's quite dark in here! 

The staff are really friendly and eager to help. As a result of my first visit, I come to Andaluz (what the cool kids call it) every other week or so. My order is always the same....

Mussels in a white wine and garlic sauce
Scallops with parma ham and leeks
Honey-mustard Chicken
Black Pudding with Apple mango chutney

I usually go with someone else, and the above selection usually fills us up. I thoroughly recommend the Black Pudding with chutney, and it goes really well with the honey-chicken.

The only bad thing about Andaluz is the price of wine - the cheapest bottle is around £13, but I suppose the free mints at the door compensate for this.I came here on a second date with a guy once and swiftly ordered the French Martini (as I had been watching Sex and The City all day). It arrived with a huge blueberry in the centre, which I thought was a nice touch. So nice, infact, that I then threw the martini all over the girl next to me and smashed my glass. Real smooth.

Clumsiness aside, I really liked Gusto's. They have a nice layout, with a huge table in the middle to accomodate bigger parties and small booths and intimate tables all around it. My mum and I ordered the garlic bread on the side - big mistake! It was huge! Too big for us to share!
I had duck, which was cooked to perfection. My mum had spaghetti Carbonara which she said was really light and not too much. They aways have a decent discount on offer, so ask the waiter/waitress for the latest deals.I'm with Alice and Jonathan on this one, I HATE this club. To be fair though, it's because of personal experiences so I've given it the benefit of the doubt, star-wise. 

This club and Lulu are the main haunts for the yah's and socialites of the city. It sometimes screams pretentious, but sometimes it's actually pretty normal! The main student nights are Thursday and Friday, so avoid them if you don't want to be asked for a cigarette and what daddy does.

I came here on a Saturday with my mum (HI MUM!) and my brothers after my brothers 21st dinner. There were about 15 of us, so we got priority entry and a table in a sectioned off area. Hey, we were pretty special. My mum and I went to the bathroom and when we went to go back to our table, they wouldn't let us in!! They said once we had left we couldn't get back. There was nothing we could say or do, so we ended up going home. 
Leading on from this, the bouncers here are amongst the worst I've ever come across. Give them a little bit of power and they think they can dictate your life. PAH!

ahem.

So, overall it's not that bad. It can be a bitty yah, but it does play quite good music and it can be a good night. The smoking area is tiny (they are just steps Opal!) and the queue can be a nightmare. I've waited in excess of 1 hour here, in the freezing cold, only to be pushed inside to a crammed bar, crammed dancefloor and no toilet roll in any cubicle. No thanks.Louis louis louis!

Remember when this craze kicked off? I think there are more fake louis vuitton bags than real ones. 
This shop is nice enough though, but there is definitely an air of tension. I always feel unworthy in here. The doormen and the staff eyeing you up and down, just don't feel welcome. Even if you have a real louis, you feel like you've got a fake because of all the eyes following you. 

Every single time I've been in here it's been full of tourists. Yeah that's fine, but I think it sums up it's success in Edinburgh. Locals wouldn't particularly come here. 

Their window displays are amazing though, I must admit.There are few things in life I love more than stationary. It's probably in my top 5 favourite things in the whole wide world! Thus, Paperchase is my heaven.

They have the most amazing selection of stationary, cards, wrapping paper and everything you could possibly want, really. They don't just have lots, the things they have are amazing! I bought a really cute stapler and punch set here with a really cute floral pattern. I bought one for my mum too - she loved it!

The one downfall for Paperchase is the price - it can be really expensive. Trust me though, it's worth it!I've been here a few times as part of pub crawls or staff nights out. I always think it's a decent enough place, but actually it's quite over-priced and not good value for money! the drinks are quite expensive - I was £4 for a Gin and Tonic (single!) and the food wasn't anything special - my lasagne was cold and the 'salad' was a lettuce leaf.

It gets really busy at the weekends and during sport events, the bug screen outside is a nice touch. Not for me though!I've lived in Edinburgh for over 4 years and I've walked past this place almost every day, and not once have I been tempted to go in.

It's huge, it's tacky and it's a place to go if you want to pull. All the way.

It's really rough too, there are ALWAYS police cars here. I think they close the grassmarket after 10pm at the weekend purely to keep people who go to Siglo alive.I didn't really know too much about Japanese food - I mainly thought it was sushi and that's it. I was wrong!!

This is a lovely place, as Jonathan M has said its location is beautiful (if a bit odd). The restaurant is really well decorated and laid out, I came here for a birthday party with about 40 people and we all fit in nicely.
I'm not sure if the quality of the food was high as I am a total Japanese food novice, but it tasted good to me. If there was one thing, I did find the portion sizes a bit small, but then again everything is small in Japan.I like Howie's, it's always got a really strong and vibrant atmosphere and even if it's not really busy, the music and the staff make it seem like it is. 
I had a lovely and light duck salad to start, it was really tasty. My brothers both had haggis which they  said was brilliant. Haggis tends to get a bad press, most people would see it on a menu and avoid like the plague, but this version would make me order it. For main I had the special of the day, which was GORGEOUS  - venison with cabbage and potatoes in a red currant jus has never tasted so delicious. My brothers wern't too happy with their seabream (the healthy option, what did they expect) but said the banoffee pie was  delicious.
The interior is lovely too, the stone walls work well. The waitress was lovely too - she was interested in the food and very helpful!There are not many bars/restaurants in Edinburgh that I visit time and time again and never get bored, but Le Monde is definitely one. It is super cool and always busy, which just shows it's popularity. For the suave amongst us, you will know that 'Le Monde' means 'the world' and indeed there are several sections of the bar with different themes, Paris, Milan etc. It is very cool. I can't recommend it highly enough.

As if the decor wasn't enough to lure you in, they have a great drinks menu. At the bar, ask for Gregor, he whips up a mean Raspberry Mojito! Furthermore, for a mere £4 you can buy a loyalty card with amazing food and drink discount, you can recoup your £4 within the first round. On a Monday everything is 2 for 1 and they have great offers,sometimes even giving away free food just for being there. I can thoroughly recommend the Thai Curry - yummy yummy yummy. 
One of the best parts of Le Monde is the fact that they have two female toilets. On a busy Saturday night there is virtually no queue for the loo, and they are very clean. It's the simple things..

I have heard people talk about Le Monde saying they wish they had found it sooner. Well, my friends, you have no excuse. Trust me, it's worth it.You can quite easily walk past this hotel because it sits quietly on the road, minding its own business. But when you take the time to go in here, wow. It's so chic, really really modern and trendy, a place for professionals!
The hotel rooms are lovely too and it is in such a great location for first-time visits to the city. It has everything you would want from a hotel!
They have a really good wine bar, Du vin, which is a great place to spend the evenings!

There are usually good deals on the internet for this hotel too, worth a look!Du Vin is the wine bar in the beautiful hotel, Hotel du Vin. It's uber classy and ultra chic. My sort of place!

There is such a great mix of people in here , professionals just getting a drink with a really laid-back atmosphere. You;re not pestered by sleazy guys spilling their beer on you whilst telling you about their amazing job and fast car etc etc.

it's a really classy wine bar, and the wine is chilled to perfection. They really know their stuff!I'm the same as Amy G - I didn't even know this existed until quite recently! I wish I did though, I would have been here every single week!

It has such a lovely atmosphere and the people are absolutely lovely! It's like all of Edinburgh's finest congregate here, only the good people get in. A bit like Lost (but who really knows what Lost is about anyway).

The food is amazing, all local and all fresh. I think I've found my new night to cook! Every Saturday I vow, fellow yelpers, to come to the Farmers Market, buy delicious food and cook it in the evening. you're welcome to join.This is such a cool little cafe! It's really quirky, funky, trendy and all the other words ending in 'y' you can think of! It is so refreshing to have such a cool cafe in Edinburgh, although it is a little out of the way.
They have a great menu for breakfast and lunch, but I've only ever gone for a coffee and a cake. And good golly, is it good cake. It's practically enough for lunch!!
I can HIGHLY recommend their scones - all made to order and nice and toasty. you can have anything you want with them - good ole cream and jam or a little more adventurous peanutbutter and jam. My mouth is watering as I write this.

Infact, I'm off to Lorna's. Meet you there!This is a lovely restaurant in a great location, just outside the city centre. The food is really lovely too - I had  the chicken skewers too and they were marinated to perfection and had a lovely aromatic taste to them. Although I didn't have desert, my brother told me that his ice cream sorbet was delicious and he asked for a second portion! I think he only did this because I was footing the bill, but it was his birthday afterall.
I'm with Rafael on this one, I'll definitely be back!This is your bog-standard Edinburgh tourist pub. It's named to attract tourist, it's decorated to attract tourists and it attracts tourists. It's very Scottish and very traditional, it embodies everything that is deemed Scottish. As a Scott, I avoid these places like the plague and I am reminded why when I go in - I'm almost a novelty to tourists when they hear my northern accent. No, this place is definitely not for me, but tourists lap this stuff up. Not very authentic, but a nice enough place if you're visiting.This restaurant is one of Edinburgh's gems. It has brilliant views of the city form the balcony, and is really quite cool!
It is split into two parts, one slightly cheaper and one more expensive, but both are really wonderful. The food is amongst the best I've had in Edinburgh and the service is un-faultable (is that a word?). 
As has been said, the cocktails are to die for. My mum and I are actually in the brochure in hotel books sitting at this bar sipping Martinis - no autographs please.

Seriously, one of the best places in the city. If you want to come then be sure to book though. My gran has trouble eating some foods, so we didn't really know where to take her for dinner when she came to Edinburgh....but we took her here and she loved it! Especially the mashed potatoes for some reason...!

10 out of 10!It looks sort of mysterious, almost gothic from the outside. To be perfectly honest this put me off a little bit, I'm a bit scared of this particular trend! But I was wrong. It's quite nice inside, really quite quirky and surprisingly modern. Although there is definitely still a gothic theme.

It looks lovely to sit outside in the summer, which people always are. I think if you did, work on your best 'grunge' look.How often do you come across a cheese shop? 

Ok, let me re-phrase ... If is not often that you come across a cheese shop. Especially one as good as Clark's Speciality Foods in Bruntsfield. I never really 'got' cheese until my brother decided to work his way through series one of Come Dine With Me, and I've found that I have quite a healthy appetite for it. This small shop is the perfect place for all your cheesy-dreams to come true. It's really traditional and quaint and is the sort of place I want to take my Grandparents to, to show them where I shop. The staff are very friendly and the whole experience is a thoroughly enjoyable one.

I would recommend this shop to people throwing a big dinner party, or trying to impress that someone special - everyone knows that cheese is the way to a woman's heart. 
(...quite literally, if you think about cholesterol...)Thyme. Oh.My.God. I like to think that I'm a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to sandwiches. My boyfriend tells me I'm the best at making them, and I have the hips to prove that I like a good sandwich. So imagine my surprise when I popped into a local sandwich shop en route to university and came across the best sandwich shop ever created. Ever.
Thyme, half way up (or down, whichever way you look at it) Holyrood Road has always caught my eye as the queue is always out the door. Mainly men and women in suits, I was always intrigued to find out what they were willing to get frizzy hair for.
I must admit, I was dubious as I was instructed to choose my own bread from a skanky-looking bread bin in the corner, but was redeemed when I saw all the fillings I could have inside it. Most impressively, their vegetarian options board is just as big, if not bigger than their meat board and to be honest, it's better. I can HIGHLY recommend the bacon, brie and cranberry - quite frankly it's better than sex (sorry mum). Coronation Chicken and Mango, tuna flakes and Cashew nuts and Falafel and Mascarpone are amongst my favourites. They even have a filling of the week. And soup! The next best thing after my Gran's Broth.

AND THERE'S MORE! They do amazing smoothies made right infront of you, and soup and salads - I've just started getting into the salads (which they make with half cous cous half leaves, or to your preference) as a healthier option (remember the previous hips comment). The selection they offer is unbelievable. And it's cheap! Complete with 10% student discount - I think I love this place. I can buy two bacon and brie sandwiches for under £5. Bargain.

I don't think I've got the message across quite enough - Thyme is brilliant. It's a small shop yes, and always has a big queue, but my God it's worth it. There are not many things I will get frizzy hair for, and these sandwiches are one of them. I feel sorry for Thyme competing to bigger, crappier and more expensive 'Foodies' right next door, but, fellow enthusiasts, we know quality when we find it and Thyme is quality.Bacon and Brie and Cranberry - I love you

Honestly,it's the food of the Gods. Every single time I take a bite it hits me. I've tried to make my own version at home but it never seems to be the same. Ugh!!

The staff are really friendly though, they make the sandwiches infront of you, it's sortof like an upper-class Subway. Watch out for the queues though, it's getting more popular...!When this hotel first opened, it was the talk of the town. I can thoroughly understand why! The bar is gorgeous - totally different from anywhere else in Edinburgh. Yeah there are other bars in Edinburgh that are trendy and have great style - but do they have Prosecco on tap? I think not.

I was here when it first opened, and I have to admit the uniforms are a bit questionable. But the overall experience is one that I go back to time and time again. The decor is really trendy, bathrooms are amazing and the staff are lovely. They give you peanuts too!

It's a lovely bar in a really nice location. I have a feeling that this is going to be the place to be in Edinburgh during the festival. You heard it here first, folksI was a regular here when it was 'Massa' - the 50p drinks and crackin tunes were my perfect night out. I was a bit hesitant when it changed hands to Electric Circus, and a bit more hesitant when I heard it would was a karaoke bar. 

There were a few things that first struck me when I went into Electric Circus - the cool, bright colours, the mirrors and the fact that the vodka they served wasn't paint-stripper anymore! Yey! All the little rooms were really cute and the perfect size for a group of friends, taking turns to belt out the tunes. I must admit I was in my element - microphone in hand, all my friends around me, the bar behind me...what's not to like!!

They have still managed to keep the buzzing atmosphere in the main part of the club. I hate to say it....but I think I like it even better than when it was Massa!I was so intrigued at their tv screens outside the bar....are they see-through? How can you have a see-through tv? I was sure I can see into the bar but it's also showing me tv....?!

Magical mysteries aside, it's a pretty ok pub. Not amazing, but ok. It's really old fashioned and cliquey.

As it's on Rose street it's part of the famous rose-street pub crawl, so it can get quite busy. It's not a bad place though!I was really surprised one fine afternoon to find that my beloved Groggs was now a seafood restaurant called 'seadogs' and looked surprisingly chic! What happened Groggs?!

Nostalgia aside, I was intrigued by this place because it looked to nice. The creamy exterior and subtle signs made me want to find out more. the menu looked good, so in I went!

You won't be disappointed with Seadogs. It's as good a fish restaurant as you'll get! Ok, there is an absolutely brilliant fish restaurant further down Rose Street, but Seadogs beats it on price for sure.

What I really liked to see is that they have incorporated the fishing quota pandemics into their service. I grew up in a fishing town, so am well aware how important it is not to over-fish etc etc, so it was good to see their caring side.

Overall, a lovely place to come to, it's hip-hop-and-happening (as my dad would say)I quite like pink olive! It's a really nice place to go for a lunch with the girls, or boys, or both. It's quite stylish in its own little way - it doesn't try to be cool or chic, it's just happy in its own skin, which is kinda refreshing! It's in a good location too, just off Edinburgh University's main campus, and as a result I think they have tried to get as much custom as they can, and cramming in the tables to accommodate.

It's a nice place if you're looking for somewhere easy, simple and really pleasant! To quote Arnie, I'll be back.This is a lovely little cafe that is very traditional. As Fiona said, it is very traditional and has a strong sense of home-cooking about it.

Their bagels are to die for. There's no other way to put it. They are amazing, but their prices aren't. Yeah it's probably one of the best bagels I've ever had, but also one of the most expensive. 
Their smoothies too are really good, this is probably what I buy most from here. They have a variety to choose from, and if you tell the people behind the counter what you need - i.e. either energy boost or something to lift you up, they will provide.Black Medicine is one of those cool, trendy places that I always feel a bit guilty for being in - I'm not very cool you see.

The thick, wooden benches and chic pedestal-tables kind of summarize the style of this coffee shop - organically chic. However I was surprised at the price, where some things are really cheap (black coffee, tea, hot chocolate), any deviation of that is quite expensive.

overall it's a really nice, relaxing place. It has been a bit if a victim of its own success, however, as it can get uncomfortably busy. They have free wifi too, so it's impossible to get one of the window seats - but when you do it's blissLulu is really trendy and cool. It follows on from Tigerlilly, upstairs and maintains the ultra chic and glamour look.

The bar always has really good drinks deals (£1.50 drinks etc) and it's pretty easy to get served  - no more than 5 minutes usually - but don't count on that. The music is sometimes good, sometimes bad. Like any club, it's a hit or a miss.

The only downside of this bar is the size...it's pretty tiny. I was once on the dancefloor and some of the roof fell onto my head - i'm 5"8, 5"10 with heels, yet my head was touching the roof. What's up with that?! That;s wack, man. The toilets are nice, infact they should have made less room for the toilets and more room for the dancefloor. When it's busy in here, it's totally uncomfortable and really awkward to navigate around. And it's always busy in Lulu!I was taken here once by a group of my ex-boyfriend friends, who all go to Napier. As it is just a 5 minute walk from the Napier Halls, it's their local. As a result it was full of shouting students and roudy drunks. Not really my scene.

The bar itself is reasonably nice, it's a nice dark brown and cream theme. But the seats are grotty and tables are sticky. We went to play pool and only one pool queue was in operation, it made the whole thing quite difficult. When I was there they were showing the Superbowl so every other minute people would be screaming in my ear or swearing at a bad call.  
The staff were quite snippy too, I didn't feel very welcomed, and they made no effort to clear up all the empties we were beside.Yeah I agree with Amy G and Emma C before me - this particular Debenhams really isn't the best showcase, but Debenhams is ace - lets not lie!

It's the sort of place you can spend the whole day in. They have everything you could possibly want, tights, shoes, dresses....and that's just the menswear. 

Yeah, this branch is grotty and I'm often left feeling a bit dirty when I leave, but call it my guilty pleasure. You really can't fault the quality, the price and the staff.If you've not heard of Topshop, then you've been living under a rock for the past ten years. There are not many business tycoons I can name, but Philip Green - the creator of Topshop - has caught my attention. Yeah this is your standard Topshop clothes - wise, but it rises above all others i've been in for friendliness and layout.

This particular store was given a really cool refurbishment last year, and now it looks really trendy and captures an old, traditional element of Edinburgh with the sweeping staircase and chunky banisters. As a result, you actually have room to browse without bumping satchel's or stepping on gladiator-clad toes. (See what I did there? Cos Topshop sells satchels and gladiator shoes...)

The staff are really friendly and genuinely want to help and give really good advice without seeming pretentious. The personal shopper, which you can just turn up to (!!), is AMAZING. I thoroughly recommend it. I came to the personal shopper as I was going out that night and was going to be in the company of an ex-boyfriend, so had to look my best. I'm glad to report the personal shopper put me right at ease and made me feel amazing, and my ex was truly swooning. HA!Whenever I have a birthday coming up I head straight to Joy. they always have really quirky things. In Edinburgh, there are not many places you could go to buy some of the stuff that Glasgow or London have on every corner, so it's refreshing to see Joy.

As well as really fun birthday cards, quirky presents and really beautiful photoframes, they also have a really trendy fashion line. I bought a beautiful cream coat here last season for £30 and always get compliments on it. I was surprised at how nice their clothes were.

Some of their stock can verge on tacky, but overall it's really good value for money and always have good deals on.This fancy-dress shop is really quite small, but packs a punch! It is crammed with really cool, funny costumes and looks brilliant. I wandered in here once and came out with bangers. Remember them? I had a great time throwing them at un-suspecting passers by. My brother came out with a really disgusting mask, which he went on to win a bottle of champagne with, so the quality of their costumes is high,

I am planning on going back, just for the bangers.How often have you come across an apothecary?! The only time I was ever aware of such things was in high school studying the plague. So naturally I had to go in. I was so surprised by the amount of different scents, candles, soaps creams, and everything else smelly. Yeah it was really expensive (£13 for a bar of soap...) but if you're having a big party, or trying to impress your mother-in-law, or just want to feel posh for a while then it's worth it.

Furthermore, when I was in I noticed they were doing MINX nails - google it!! I've seen them in magazines and nearly started to cry when I was given an appointment as part of my 21st.This is a little too much for me to handle.

Sorry.....I don't get it.

Yeah it's really colourful and looks really enticing, but come on, £5 for 10 beads?? You having a laugh?

I know there's a market for this, and I understand that it's quite a big one, but sorry little bead shop, not for meI used to associate this ultra-chic restaurant/bar with those who liked to be seen in Edinburgh (yah's etc) as it was once a private-members club, so imagine my surprise when I went to Hawk and Hunter for a friends birthday - it was really, really lovely!! The decor is really chic and the toilets are amongst some of the best I've ever experienced in Edinburgh. There are two quality indicators I like to use when reviewing places  - the toilet and the temperature of the wine. I give Hawke and Hunter 10 out of 10 for both. Especially the bathroom, it's worth visiting for that reason alone.

The Georgian style of the restaurant is typical of Edinburgh New-Town, with a really dramatic sweeping staircase taking you up to the bar, and up again to the restaurant. It's really cool, and I loved just sitting on the sofa's looking around me. The only thing I would criticize, which I would by lying if I said I didn't expect, was the price. You just know you're going to be paying for the drink as well as for the surroundings. Otherwise, it's really worthwhile paying it a visit. PLUS it's open till 3am - for the suave amongst us who like to be out but don't like the stinky clubs, this is the place to go.Lazy Lohan's is a bistro with a difference in Edinburgh. My first visit was somewhat disappointing, they had not long opened and hadn't got a liqueur license yet so we had to bring our own, and service was slow. Plus we were the only diners. But my second visit, for lunch, was somewhat better. The food is good, really yummy and enjoyable, but again I was disappointed with the service. And the restaurant is tiny, very small. There are only around 6 tables in total, and I imagine it would be very cramped when full. However, whenever I walk past the bistro it never seems to be open. I get the impression it's the sort of place you need to book, and yes it's pleasant and the food is great, but the location and size is a shame. It has potential, a diamond in the rough.It was sunny this morning as I was walking through the meadows, and I felt amazing. I looked bad  - last nights make-up and baggy jumper,  one martini too many last night, but I felt amazing. There's something really liberating to be able to walk through such a beautiful part of town and feel completely safe. There were a group of kids playing football on the left, and a man practicing his juggling on the right, as well as numerous blankets sprawled all across the green green grass, and I felt cool damnit. 
I live in a different part of town now, but I really miss walking through the meadows. Every week (sometimes every day) there's something fun going on in the meadows, whether it is seeing speech bubbles coming out of the trees or a cream-pie fight, there is always something to do. It's probably one of the best kept secrets in Edinburgh , I certainly never see any tourists around the area. But they should be - for me, it's one of the best things about the cityAfter spending the day here, I've decided I love the Meadows more than most. Reasons include :

- you can sit on the grass all day and nobody takes much notice
- you can sit alone and be perfectly normal
- you can take a picnic
- you can join in games
- you get asked to join in games
- it's wonderfully green
- no dog shit
- no pesky cyclists almost killing you

it's blissThe picturehouse always attracts a huge crowd, and is always busy. It is an absolutely brilliant venue for concerts and is an absolutely brilliant club!! I always have a good night here - regardless of the company, because I know the music and the atmosphere will carry me through the night.

to be honest, I don't have to say much more  - the previous Yelpers have said it all! It's brilliant - go go go!!What a cool name?

They have a great selection of beef-burgers - literally whatever you want, you'll get. My only gripe is with their selection of other burgers, however, as I don't really eat red-meat and their chicken-burger selection wasn't quite as extensive. But my brothers were in their element choosing their burgers.

It's your standard burger/milkshake combination - when will we realise that mince-meat and strawberry milk don't go well together!! But separately they work wonderfully.

It is a nice place to get a good, hearty meal and I would recommend it if you love beef-burgers.I had to laugh when I saw the other reviews for this dump got 1* too - I don;t think I need to write any more....!!

My flatmates boyfriend recently started a new night in City on a Friday called Broke! Luckily for him, it;s been really successful and I've gone once or twice and it's not too bad. When I've been outwith Broke, however, it has been awful. Full of under-age wannabe's getting wasted and groups of lads having a VK competition...the music is horribly bad, the dancefloor is ridiculously packed at all times and the floor is disgusting.

They often have themed nights that seem appealing but believe me  - AVOID AVOID AVOIDI couldn't have imagined that this place could get any worse......I was wrong.

I left City the other night, knowing it was a mere 5 minute walk to my flat and knowing I was totally safe....until I opened my bag and found a bit of paper saying ...

'hey baby, you're sexy, call me on 07921.......'

c'mon, seriously????Bruntsfield is one of Edinbrugh's best kept secrets.

It's a relatively large area in the centre/East of Edinburgh. It is a mere 15 minute walk from Princes Street, and is a haven of small shops, cute cafe's and is home to the wonderful meadows. The main street in Bruntsfield is Bruntsfield place, and it is the only street with any sort of liveliness. i quite like this, as everything you would like to see is laid out infront of you. The cheese shop is renowned throughout Edinburgh, and the family butchers is one of the few places still run by a family. Whether you want exotic jewelry, 'posh' chocolate, a coffee, an outfit for your brothers baby or a cricket bat, Bruntsfield is the place to be.
I've lived in Edinburgh for 4 years now, and if ever I need something, I would always go to Bruntsfield. For one thing, you can always get a parking space, and the people are so friendly and welcoming I never want to leave. Bruntsfield is at the end of the Meadows in Edinburgh, a well-known and well-loved huuge area of green grass, green trees and great people. It's standard practice in Edinburgh to sit on the meadows or play a game of mini-golf and stroll up to Bruntsfield.
On top of this, there are a few celebrities (and I'm talking good celebrities, proper A-listers, not just Big Brother rejects) who live in Bruntsfield and the surrounding area, so you could well be sitting next to someone famous sipping your espresso admiring your new shoes. 
You can walk down Bruntsfield in your best Karen Millen dress or in your slouchy-trousers without getting a second glance. It's just a really cool place, similar to Notting Hill in London. 10/10!Every time I go here, I can't help but love it.For those 'in the know', the chocolate tree has been an online business for quite some time, but decided to open up their own shop in our very own city, Edinburgh. If you like chocolate, you will LOVE The Chocolate Tree. Located in the trendy Bruntsfield area, it is in the perfect position to sit in and gorge or sit out and gorge. Their chocolates are all organic (so at least your conscious feels good about eating copious amounts of chocolate...)

The decor is very chic, trendy and indulgent. Indeed, I think Indulgence is a theme in the cafe. My first visit was under sad circumstances - recently single and feeling vulnerable, my friend took me and ordered me the 'Spanish Hot Chocolate' (see picture). Oh My God. Where I was feeling despairing, distraught and dismayed I was overcome with delight, deliriousness and felt thoroughly delectable!! It was perfect...perhaps a bit rich, but the first few sips were to die for. It even came with a little dough cake-thing to dip into the thick, gloopy chocolate, like fondue! It would have been ideal for two to share.

To be honest, I'm not what you would call a choc-a-holic - especially now that Cadbury's is no longer considered 'chocolate'. But there is something for everyone to enjoy, whether its a slice of their GLORIOUS chocolate cake (it was delicious, after a while I felt I should find a mirror to check if my pupils had dilated) or one of their mini chocolate bites.

If you can't make it to the shop they sell online and they're much cheaper than their competition ( it's one of their ethical principles, woohoo!). It really is worth visiting, on a warm summer day to lounge and indulge yourself, or on a cold winter evening to keep yourself warm. It's the sort of place I imagine Harry Potter would sit in...Good Ole Rabbie Burns! or not...as in the case of the tourist Cafe on the Royal Mile. The name may be appealing, but trust me - thats the extent of its appeal. Yeah ok, it's a pleasant place, nice and clean and a reasonable layout but the overall experience leaves a lot to be desired, I'm afraid to say...

You can tell it's aimed at tourists as the menu has a quaint Scottish twist, such as 'a wee rolly' and 'haggis and mare haggis' . Being a local, I avoid these places like the plague. I generally try to avoid the Royal Mile, but I can understand its appeal for visitors.

the menu of Rabbie Burns isn't exactly extensive, don't expect fois gras and terrine of duck. More like...4 cheese panini and Macaroni Cheese. Yeah, don't get me wrong, if you're looking for a quick, cheap bite to eat while catching all the sights then Rabbie Burns is your place...but if you want something a little bit more exciting there are a plethora of places lined along the same street as the cafe which would fill the whole a lot betterWhenever I've been in Shanghai it's always dead. I am always enticed in here with promises of free drinks and free entrance etc by the men on the street. My friends and I never really realise he's there precisely because the club is dead.

To be fair, there have been one or two nights here that have been a great success. It has so much potential, particularly being underneath the really trendy Le Monde bar, and it has a huge dancefloor. All the ingredients are here, but the cake is soggy. 

they have a really cool fish tank on the floor when you first come in - when you walk over it the fish move and the water ripples! How cool is that!! I think I spend the majority of my time in Shanghai playing with those fish. They never see me coming.Lets not lie....it's a wee dog. Yet it;s so much more...

I'm not going to repeat the story as it's been said before and it would be pointless, but what a wonderful sentiment!!

This is not just a dog, it stands for loyalty, love and friendship. It that's not worth getting a picture beside, then what is?eugh!!!!

I had never been to a gay club before, so I didn't know what to expect. Following a scuffle with the bouncers about ID (apparently a provisional isn't adequate anymore) we finally got in. The first thing I noticed was the small, nae tiny area to check in jackets. The queue was backing up behind us and we were all crammed in. Then, whilst walking through the club, we could not get served for love nor money at the bar. I spent 1 hour there, and never got looked at once. At this point my friends had got us into VIP, so off I went, hoping there would be a bar in there - which there was......NEXT TO THE HOT TUB. Hot tub. I'm going to say that again, there was a hot tub in the vip room.

The VIP area was pretty small but it was quite nice to be able to move around and get a seat. The dancefloor was quite good though, even though they had a dark dancefloor for goodness knows what. 

The one good thing about GHQ is the drinks prices - they were dirt cheap. I thought that the closure of Massa meant the death of cheap prices, but GHQ offers £2 doubles, which is brilliant.

If I come here again, I'll make sure I have my passport, make sure I've drunk enough to be comfortable without a drink for a good hour and I'll bring my bikini.It is not often that I am rendered speechless (ask my mum) but walking into the Bruntsfield Bistro, the restaurant of the Bruntsfield Hotel, I was indeed, speechless. The decor was so chic and on-trend I was literally flabbergasted. And it's not often I use that word, as I'm sure it's not often you hear it.

Getting past the initial shock, the menu selection was great. My first visit was for a brunch (a particularly good time to visit the bistro) and was pleasantly surprised by their contemporary selections. The main meals are good too, not the best but still very good. I had duck and found it a bitty tough, but I didn't mind too much. The surroundings made up for what lacked in the food. Indeed, I felt thoroughly cool sitting there, despite the fact that nobody other than other diners could appreciate it.

Definitely worth a visit - Sunday brunch in particular.Now please, save your laughter. Bruntsfield Hoover Services - yes, it does seem a bit ridiculous, but I have lost count of the amount of times this shop has been my knight in shining armour. Think about it, how many times has your hoover broken? Or a lamp, your tv, anything! The best thing about this cute, small, family-run shop is that they will bend over backwards to help you. They are consistent with their opening hours and overall is a very pleasant experience! It's not often you can find somebody to help you with a small handy-man style job in a big city, and Bruntsfiend Hoover Service provides exactly that.Ok, I've realised the error of my ways. Where I was totally lured in by the old charm and hearty laughs of the staff here. Don't get me wrong, it's still an excellent service and definitely worthwhile, but it is, as Sam C said, quite expensive. But to be honest I don't  mind paying a little bit extra for all the times I've needed a helping hand.On a nice summers day, the majority of people will go to the meadows. But there are no bars in the meadows...!! The grassmarket is brilliant fun.  Although take it from personal experience - during the day is better than during the night. At night time, particularly at the weekend, the grassmarket turns into a hen party and stag do bonanza, as well as student pub crawls and rugby haunts. It can get a bit crazy, and a bit uncomfortable.
Which is precisely why I prefer  to come here on a nice hot day and sit outside! You can go for drinks outside at Biddy Mulligens, you can get a tour of the area, you can eat delicious food at the Steak and Mussel Inn or you can go shopping at Godiva. It's a lovely little area.
One of my favorite parts is the creperie that always sits in the middle of the square. The staff are lovely and the crepes are delicious!!

Overall, I think the Grassmarket is a wonderful part of Edinburgh that should be used more!!I love George Street. It's such a classy, trendy area in the city - it's where all the nightlife is and where all the excitement is. My mum and I always start at one end of George Street (in Le Monde) and finish at the other (Tigerlilly) and do whatever we want in between. All the bars are high-end and so are always busy, not so much with students, more young professionals. At 5-7pm the entire street is jammed with suits (usually on the prowl) and at the weekends it's full of trendy women and suave gentlemen. My mum often gets approached on George Street - it's where she met her current boyfriend!
It is really quite expensive, which is why I only go now and again, but it's great fun and everyone is sociable!There is no doubt about it - located right next to Pollock Halls, The Crags is more of less exclusively reserved for students. And what a great student pub! They have combined a traditional building with wacky cartoons everywhere. Their menu is really quirky and the staff are brilliant. One of the best things about the Crags is the size, it's really big! So if you're looking for a meal you can always get a seat (unless the football is on). The seats are great too, really big comfy sofas to sink into.

The food is your bog-standard bar food, burgers etc. As a student, it was great. They always have great offers on burgers, beer and spirits, and for £1 you could get your hands on a yellow card to give you further discount and great opportunities. 

I love the Crags! Whether you are taking your parents for lunch or watching the football, it's got a great atmosphere and is really brilliant.Scott's deli is amazing! There's no other way of putting it. Their bread is amazing, their sandwiches are amazing and the staff are amazing!
they offer gourmet catering to the masses or to yourself.  To get a baguette with 2 fillings to take-away will cost £3 and is an extra 50p per filling, or they have either small or large salad boxes if you fancy something healthier. 
I can't tell you how great this little Deli is! From the outside it looks really nice, but nowhere near as nice as it is inside and the quality you get back.
Scott - whoever you are - thank you thank you thank youPeter's Yard is a lovely little cafe in a brilliant location. You know it's going to be a classy cafe because of the black and white photos of bread and what not on the outside. Plus the interior is very mysterious and black, with slouchy leather sofas and low-set tables. You just know you wouldn't see any kappa trakka's or puffa's here.

It's within this that I have issue with.....it seems to attract a certain type of person. The type of person who sits in Peter's is either an intellect or a yah. Maybe both. 

The hot chocolate, which wasn't that great at all, cost me a whopping £4.20- yeh it comes with a little fudge slice but I don't like fudge. Jeesh.

Overall, although I was impressed with the layout and style of the cafe, I really wasn't impressed with the prices and the atmosphere. There is a lovely Starbucks just up the road which has a far calmer atmosphere and is a lot cheaper - and that's saying something.It's not often that you find small, family run businesses that have been around forever. The Bruntsfield Family Butcher has been around forever (as far as I'm concerned, I was born in 1989) and is still run by the same family.

The sign outside says 'home-made steak pie, considered by many to be the best in Scotland' and it's quite right. They have terrific meat (yeah, I said terrific) and the quality is top-notch. Whatever you want, meat-wise, this lovely family butcher is the place to goI was always told that when I went into second year, The Links would be the new Crags. I was lied to.

yeah the Links is just like the Crags, same management and same menu and drinks deals. But something is just not right,...

I came here recently with my dad on a nice summers day, we wanted somewhere cheap and cheerful for a burger with outdoor seats. The Links seemed perfect. However my burger was horrible, really greasy and my dad's was just plain disgusting. 

I asked for lemonade, which was just fizzy water, and my dad's lager was cider. The staff weren't very attentive, we had to get everything we wanted inside ourselves.

I wasn't overly impressed with the Links!! It's ok for a couple drinks or to watch the rugby, but the food is p*sh.Bleh.

Don't be fooled by the really cool wooden exterior and the mysterious interior. Ooud always caught my eye, and after a google I realised that their menu was actually really very appealing - especially their breakfast menus. And it looked quite cheap! So I wasted no time in toddling along to get my morning grenola. The entire menu looks really impressive and I made a silent vow to come back for dinner sometime while waiting to be served.
My waiting time was quite extreme - I had to wait 15 minutes to be dealt with (there was one customer infront of me) only to be told that there was no grenola....nope sorry, can't have a croissant either...no, freshly out of fruit. I left Ooud Kitchen feeling very sorry for myself.

I think I just had a bad experience, I fully intend to go back for lunch or maybe dinner, but I didn't enjoy my first visit. It's a shame, because it has so much potential with the really cool decoration and the mouth-watering menu. Watch this space...I took my grandparents here when they came to visit. I think this says it all. It's a lovely little shop selling everything from tea-cosies to candles, everything you would want in your stately home. Unfortunately for me, I live in a 2-bedroom flat in Holyrood, and have no use for this sort of stuff. Don't get me wrong - it's a lovely place and my grandparents loved it (Gran bought a cushion, she takes it out every Christmas and Meg next door is green with envy) and I'm sure it has a large market, but for the younger generation I think it simply isn't appreciated.

Maybe I'll come back when don my power-suit and 2.3 children, but until then I think I'll go to Ikea. Gran's cushion was £45, so you get a sense of the general prices. Granda still can't believe the woman who won't spend an extra £1 on real soap (she prefers Asda's own) spent that much on a cushion. A festive cushion, no less.Haymarket is quite a nice train station, if a little small. Although for it's faults to be perfectly honest it doesn't really need to be there! Edinburgh Waverly is a mere 3 minutes (on train, about 15 by foot) away and its sphere of influence is practically the same as Waverly! But I must admit I sometimes go to Haymarket rather than Waverly for a quieter, simplier train-station experience.

The building itself is really nice and traditional, and it's really easy to navigate around. As there are only 4 platforms, it's relatively easy to find the one for you. There are some lovely bars in the area and a particularly good Starbucks just outside it. 
Whenever the rugby is on, Haymarket gets mobbed. So look out for that...!This is a really cute bookshop in a lovely area of Edinburgh. It's the sort of place you spend your Sunday afternoons in. When I was in the shop I was somewhat dissapointed as it was nothing special. They had a great range of books, quirky and fun cult-novels as well as classics and factual books. It's a lovely place to be, but again, nothing particularly special.

However, upon visiting their website I see a different side to the bookshop. They have a book of the week and regular book groups you can join. I wish I had known this when I was in the shop as I would have been very interested!  I never thought I would say this, but I think I prefer the website to the shop - it has more life!Central Taxis have a brilliant automated system where you can ring them (0131 228 1211) from a landline and they automatically order the taxi for you. It's like magic!! When phoning form a mobile they always store your number and name so add a wee personal touch, which I quite like.

I've never bad a bad experience with them personally, but I know a few friends who have had problems with taxi's arriving on time etc and rude drivers, but every driver I've had has been lovely and chatty. Unlike City Cabs, their drivers drive sensibly and don't cause chaos on the roads.

Whatever you do though, don't ask about the trams...This place has my heart. Fact.

I used to study History of Art when I was in 1st and 2nd year, and every Friday we would go around the museums. When we were in the Modern Art Gallery, I was positively giddy! The second you pull up to this gallery you understand why. The gardens, designed by Capability Brown I'll have you know, are very very cool and modern. It's a bit like the Tellytubby's opening sequence. The gallery itself is amazing. It's such a lovely lovely day out, I can't tell you enough how great it is.

I know it's a but far out of the city, but there is a free bus that leaves from the Mound that comes here regularly! Brilliant! It's a green bus with paintings on it - depicting whichever exhibition is on at the gallery.

It's worth going just to look around the garden. The Dean gallery is brilliant too! I love it, and so will youGrotty, smelly and kinda cool. It's a very indie/edgy mix so I'm not sure what to think of the GRV!  It showcases all the latest bands and is a great venue for events etc, but it reeks of the sticky, smelly student pub which we all have learnt to love, right?They make the best Mocha's ever! Fact.

The staff are so very very lovely too! They love their job, and I love them for it.

I absolutely love this little box, and all the little boxes throughout the city. I totally agree with Jonathan M - if you fancy a quick coffee on the go, find one of these boxes! Truly brilliant!There are not many cinemas in Edinburgh as comfortable as this one...infact, there are no other cinema's in Edinburgh as conformable as this one! There are two main screens and a further two smaller screens, and the two main ones have sofa's! Yeah, sofa's! And recliners and the comfiest seats in the world.

The sofa's in particular are great - you can lounge out or snuggle in, whatever you prefer. You can even put your feet up. It just makes the whole viewing experience all the better! It is a bit expensive however, but I think it's worth it. I've lost count of the amount of times I've had cramp from sitting in tiny cinema chairs. Not anymore!The Kings Theatre (or Festival Theatre, if you want to be picky) holds a very special place in my heart! Every Christmas they play host to the always-enjoyable and never-cheesy Christmas Panto! Everybody loves panto...oh no they don't. oh yes they do!

The theatre itself is in a great location, just off Lothian Road and has been around for years. It offers a brilliant choice of plays and dramas and is a venue for Edinburgh's local amateur societies. It has maintained it's traditional style and retro appearance but still managed to make it look good  - I'm sure you'll know what I mean by that musty smell that always seems to be in old theatres ? Although there is a must in the Kings Theatre, it is very faint.

Ok, the seats are old-fashioned and crams everybody in so you can barely move throughout the performance, and ok the bathrooms have seen better days, but it's all part of the experience!

I always make sure I visit the Kings Theatre for my Panto fix at Christmas, and always keep an eye out to see what is coming. It's a great place to experience theatre at a low-ish price and in a nice environment. The last play I went to see was Calendar Girls, so you can understand the calibre of performances to expect at the Kings Theatre.YUM!

Cafe Crepes is exactly the sort of place that websites like this are made for! It is such a hidden gem! The crepes here are as good as any I've ever had  - and I just got back from Paris! You can make your own combination from around 30 fillings, savoury or sweet and a heap of different sauces to play around with. Following a friends recommendation, I got spicy sausage, herb sauce and marscapone and I can thoroughly recommend it to you! It was really big and you watch it being made, like a posh subway!

If crepes aren't your thing (then you're weird), then they also do great bacon and egg rolls.

You'll be able to tell from the picture, but Cafe Crepes is really quite small and so sacrificed seating! But Bruntsfield is a nice place with lots of benches! Or munch on your way to work/uni. Yes you might look a bit silly, but you'll forget all about it after the first bite.It's a shame that Wedgewood is near the bottom of the Cannongate - an area that is generally quieter than everywhere else in Edinburgh, because it really is an excellent restaurant. The staff and the food are excellent! And the price is even better!

They do a great lunch menu daily, all details are put up on the window in the morning and each option is mouth watering. I've lost count of all the times I've stood outside this restaurant and oogled the menu, drooling.

They are a bit inventive with their food - I once had parsnip creme brulee - but have an open mind and you can only be surprised! I recently ate in total darkness in a concept-restaurant in Paris (it was a weird experience but I would highly recommend it) and so I found I have started to appreciate the taste of everything now, and Wedgewood is a total dream. It's bliss!! Everybody I've spoken to about this stunning restaurant love it as much as I do - really is a great place.I was attracted to this Chinese take-away because it was part of just-eat.co.uk . For the students amongst you, you'll recognize that this is an internet-based way of getting fast food, fast. Unfortunately, being part of just-eat doesn't mean it's particularly good.

I had sweet and sour chicken (predictable, I know) and it was terrible. Really gloopy and soggy batter, and the chunks of vegetables were difficult to get around. The rice was really dry and there was a mysterious meat mixed in it....still don't know what it was. My friend had Chicken in Sataay and found it gloopy too, she said it was really spicy (which neither of us understood - it's a peanut dish) and she couldn't eat very much of it. Furthermore, it cost us £21 for the experience! There are far better and far cheaper Chinese take-aways in Edinburgh!POLLOCK!

I think Pollock Halls hold a special place in the hearts of all Edinburgh University students. It certainly does for me. The entire area is huge, fantastically huge and it is easy to get lost. There are several different houses - Chancellors, Baird, Lee, Turner, Grant, Holland (Blocks A, B, C, D and Annexe), Masson and Fraser court. I'm sure there's more I've forgotten about...!

Here's the scoop - when I was here in 2007 there was a distinct seperation between each house. Chancellors Court was generally reserved for the yah's at Edinburgh Uni - I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but the rooms are lovely, modern and clean. All en-suite, naturally. Chancellors Court and Holland are the only two houses with en-suite facilities. I stayed in Holland B block (following my brothers recommendation) and loved it. Yeah, the rooms weren't huge and the toilets were tiny, and the walls were really thin, and it got cold (wow, I'm really selling it) but it was fantastic. Because Holland was one of the older houses it had a real sense of tradition about it. I've made some brilliant memories in Holland Block!

The JMC food-court left a lot to be desired, I'm afraid to say. Their breakfasts were good, always a great selection of fruit, cereals and cooked breakfast,but their dinners went steadily downhill as the term progressed. Don't get me wrong, it was all edible (but i once got a bad bug from the beef goulash) and if there was nothing you fancied there was always salad and cold meats, but it wasn't amazing.

Overall, however, I thoroughly recommend Pollock Halls. I recently went for a drive and saw that the whole place has been updated with a whole new house being built, so I'm sure it has just got better!It's difficult to miss these great big blue no100 busses throughout Edinburgh, but boy am I glad to see them. This is the best way to get to Edinburgh Airport, right from the city centre. You are guaranteed to get there within 30minutes, normally less. The journey is a very comfortable one - even in traffic the bus flies along in the bus lane. It is really cheap too - £3 for a single or £5 for a return. The busses leave regularly from both the airport and Princes St - I've never been to either where I've not seen a bus waiting for some passengers.

Forget the £40 taxi, get the bus and you'll save money and probably get there quicker.Tempus if my favourite bar on George Street, and the standard is high. It is so unassuming, as part of the ultra-trendy George Hotel it is passed by without much of a glance, but boy oh boy. It is so cool. The furniture is really nice, big and bulky. It feels expensive. The wine glasses are huge and yes, the wine is chilled to perfection. I came for lunch and had the Tempus burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I went back the next evening for dinner and had duck - probably the best duck I've ever had. It was delicious.

The bar is my favourite part. The cocktails are expensive but really worth it (well, one or two) if he's buying...! If you don't believe me, pop in for a look. You'll end up staying, I guarantee it.It doesn't look like much from the outset, but if you know what you want and how you want it then it's fine.
Prices aren't too bad, and the food is ok, nothing special but alright. There are some good places around here that are better than Babelon, but if you're in a rush then it's good!I first experienced Globetrotters on a school trip - we were looking for something cheap, cheerful and clean! Globetrotters definitely delivered! It makes a change from your standard hotsel as the building is really beautiful, it's a typical of the Georgian-style you can see in Edinburgh's New Town and the interior is really modern! Yeah you can definitely tell it's a hostel, it reminds me a bit of an insane asylum, but it's nice enough. It's really bright and colourful.

I was in a room with 6 beds, bunk beds, and it was pleasant enough. Each bed had a little curtain to separate it from everyone else. It was quite difficult to climb up to the top-bunk, however. The bathrooms were huge - reminded me of my primary school days, but again nice and clean.

As the Inn is about 20 mins outside Edinburgh there was a free bus that took us into town whenever we wanted, and picked us up whenever we called. There were a few hen parties on the same floor as us, and it was brilliant for that.

Overall, it's quite pleasant! There was a big kitchen so we could make our own food and a nice area to eat it in. A-Ok!Potterrow is the student union for Edinburgh University, and as such I expected it to be posher than posh, the playground for all the yah's that Edinburgh University seems to attract. But it was the complete opposite! the union looks like it has just escaped from the 60s, retro decor and a huge tree in the middle of the floor. It's a nice area to sit and try to do some work but it is always really busy, and the fresh air student radio programmes are held here so it's always quite noisy.

Saturday night plays host to the Big Cheese in Potterrow - one of the best nights on a Saturday, in my opinion! The music comes straight from the 70s, 80s and 90s so it's great fun to sing along and re-live my youth. Although it's more or less the same music every week, so I try to go as little as I can so I can fully enjoy my night here. It's a great place to be for a student, but for a member of the general public...not so muchOk, I have officially fallen in love with Potterow. it plays the WORST but the BEST music ever, it has the cheesiest men and the bouncers are brilliant criac.

I love it!!!!the Omni centre is like the Chuck Norris of entertainment.

Whatever you fancy doing - having a drink, going for a run, going to see a movie, maybe you fancy a swim, or if you fancy dinner, The Omni Centre is your place. They have everything from a Virgin Active Gym to a bar that does karaoke - WITH A LIVE BAND! I'm no Whitney, but I've been up on that stage more than once. The whole place is always buzzing and it's always busy. As a result of being in the Omni Centre, the bars and restaurants are really quite expensive and the parking is extortionate! (helpful hint...if it's after 6pm just park anywhere around the centre!) . It's a really nice place to come for the day, everything is under the same roof. I've been on a few first dates here and it makes the whole awkward and uncomfortable parts less! woohoo!who doesn't love Office? Their shoes are amazing.

However, this particular branch isn't so. It's really quite small, and as a result it gets very busy very quickly. Do you know how hard it is to swoon over shoes when you're looking over the shoulder of the lady infront of you and stepping back to let the group of school children past. eugh!

I would say that this is only the problem during the weekend, but it's always busy - especially when there is a sale. They always seem to have sales too - just to pour salt into the wounds. 

The staff are friendly and always in demand, so if you see something you like then expect to wait. I think in the case of Office, the quality of the shoes have to come before the shop itself, otherwise you'll never come here again!

Personally, I'll stick to the website. They always have my size, and I can shop in my pyjamasI've lived on Holyrood Road for over 2 years now, and it still never seems to get any better of livelier. At one point, we had a small (but successful) supermarket but was, sadly, short-lived. Yeah there are two nice sandwich shops and a nice coffee shop. But that's it. That's where the liveliness ends. It drives me crazy that I have to get in the car for a pint of milk, and the nearest supermarket is about 10mins away by car. The area has so much potential and it drives me crazy to think that it's just sitting there doing nothing! Whenever I see a tourist here I lingure a bit to see if they need directions - they must be lost. 
It is next door to the Parliament, the Palace, Dynamic Earth and has great views of the Craggs and Arthurs Seat....yet it has nothing special about it. I wish it had a bit more life! It's a famous road so it should have something more to offer than a couple coffee shops and a seedy housing estate!This is my earliest memory of Edinburgh. I came down here with my family to visit the city for the first time, and fell in love. These apprtments are brilliant, they are really modern with great colour schemes and are really comfortable and easy to live in. At that time, I was the youngest of a family of 5, so we were used to being crammed together but in these appartments you wouldn't notice. The doors are quite heavy, and we got a complaint from the neighbours for slamming them - which we weren't! - so be wary of the weight of them. It's a really nice place to stay in a nice part of the city, if you're a family looking for somewhere cheap I would thoroughly recommend this.I probably don't frequent the library as much as I should (sorry mum) but I do often meet friends in the café for lunch. The café is a new extension to the library, and a welcome one at that. It's nice to have a comfortable place to sit and meet up with friends, when you can get a seat. This is the main problem of the café, there are never enough seats. If you're meeting someone at lunchtime, there's no point in even looking for a seat. I've lost count of the amount of times I've stood waiting on a table, watching some poor soul try to scoff down their Panini as quickly as possible.
It's a nice enough place with really friendly people, and the food is ok - nothing adventurous or particularly exciting, Panini's, salads and soup feature heavily. As I said, the seating is an issue and they don't accept cards. This wouldn't be a big problem, but the nearest cash machine is a good walk away (uphill) and you lose your place in the queue.I've always been a Vodafone customer, but on several occasions leaving this particular store I've vowed to leave! It is ridiculous in here, it embodies everything I loathe about large mobile companies. Any enquiry I've ever had going into this shop has been met with 'phone the customer helpline' - every single time. When I've gone in to get some help with my phone I've always had to wait at least 20minutes (if I've not walked out by then) or, surprise surprise I'm told to phone the customer helpline. AGHH!!!
It really frustrates me in this shop, it's almost as if they don't want my custom. Every other Vodafone store I've been in has been brilliant and I've been really pleased and satisfied with the service I've received, but this particular branch really gets my goat. And I want my goat back.just as busy

just as useless

just as rude

boo to you, vodafone!!Meadowbank Shopping Centre has one of the only supermarkets in the Holyrood/Abbeyhill area, so it is always busy. There is a Sainsburys, a TK Maxx, A Marks and Spencers Outlet, Bingo, KFC and Peacocks! The choice isn't much but if you're looking for simple things then it's great. The car park is quite difficult to navigate around and you'll be lucky to get a space close to any of the entrances. To be honest I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Meadowbank unless I'm food-shopping or need something  from a particular shop because there's not much there!This is one of the only 24/7 supermarkets I'm aware of in Edinburgh, and I practically live here. As odd as it sounds, I prefer to do my food shopping after midnight because it's really quiet and I can take my time. This particular Asda is huge, it even has a McDonalds, and is brilliant because you can get absolutely anything you want. I was looking for wheat-free flour and my first stop was this Asda and it delivered.
The only thing about shopping here after midnight is the tills - they are all closed and you have to use the self-service ones. But if you're normal, unlike me, then this shouldn't be a problem.Jees...this place has it all!!! Literally anything in the world that you need (sports related, of course) you'll get it here.

When I first came in I was taken aback by the price of everything, it all seemed quite expensive, but when I got upstairs I saw a lot of the same things for a quarter of the price. Nicely played, Sports Direct.

The staff are really friendly and happy to help..ok maybe not as cheerful as I would have liked but hey, everyone has a bad dayEdinburgh is a beautiful city racked with history. As a result, there are 4 or 5 different bus companies all with different routes for tourists to see the city. 
Living in Edinburgh, I have to admit I find these busses really frustrating at times, but they are always popular. The City Sightseeing busses are always the busiest and to be honest they have the better route. Tickets can range from £6 for kids and £12 for adults, but there are always discounts available from tourist guides and tickets for the castle etc.

The bus comes with a sound-track that you can listen to with headphones and offers an excellent way to learn all about the city. If you're visiting the city for the first time, this is definitely the first thing you should do.Waverly is one of my favourite train stations ever. It's a bit weird to have a list of favourite train stations - I get that - but I've had to be in a fair few in my time for various reasons. Waverly is always really well looked after, really easy to navigate around and there are staff readily available to help.

One thing I always appreciate in Waverly is the presence of 2 police officers. Yeah, we've all been on the train with a drunken group of lads or whatever, so it's really comforting to see that the streets remain safe.
It can be  a bit awkward to find which platform you are meant to be on - particularly if you're going north, but if you leave plenty time then it's fine and dandy. 

It's really good that there is more than 1 exit too. There's nothing more annoying than having to take the long way to get somewhere that would take a few seconds if there was only a door! Alas, in Waverly there is just that!! There are 3 main exits - one onto MArket Street, one onto North Bridge and one onto Princes Street. Perfect!I must admit I was a bit worried when I heard that Edinburgh was going to get an Urban Outfitters in 2009. If you know anything about Edinburgh, you'll know that there is a distinct style, that of the 'yah'. Hence why my heart sank a bit at the thought of Urban Outfitters - Edinburgh would get an entirely new species of yah - the cool one. But you know what? It's not so bad.

Urban Outfitters has always been known for its edgy fashion and quirky bits n bobs. Rather than feel out of place in this ultra-cool shop, I felt quite at home! The layout is a bit difficult to navigate - the ground floor is ALWAYS busy yet the first floor, which is also womenswear, is never busy and all the dressing rooms are up here. 
Helpful hint - don't go here on a Saturday, there's just no point. The tills are also not in a great place, the queue clogs up the shop-floor and it's difficult to move around. But overall it's a great new arrival to the Princes St brigade.The Dome is just a wonderful place to go to in Edinburgh. It really is special, and  is something tourists have to see.
The dome Garden Cafe always looks wonderful too. It is in a great location, on Rose Street but down a few steps so it's in its own little world. It's always busy too, despite being al fresco. 
I totally agree with Fiona, it really is an oasis! Because it is down some steps it is in its own little cul-de-sac, avoiding the wind yet trapping the sun. If it rains they have a lovely cover too. It's a great place!

The food is really good, if a little pricey. They offer lovely lunchtime sandwiches or salads, and have a bigger menu if you fancy. Their chicken salad is my favourite.what a lovely part of town!!

This park, albeit a small one (tiny even), is just such a lovely place to be on a nice sunny day! All the locals in Edinburgh hit the meadows as soon as the sun is out, so as a result tourists and people who don't know about the meadows come to St Andrews Square. It has recently had an upgrade, and now there is always something exciting going on. The other week they were home to a series of photographs and wine-tasting tents. There is always something going on here.

There is a cute little coffee hut too for all your food and drink needs (for a price) so it's really easy to just sit here all day long. It's really clean and always busy. All the 'edgy' kids from the Newtown come here too, so it's a trend-spotting area. Dress to be seen, because you'll be watched!Koko is replacing Native State - a student-based bar/restaurant that held a special place in my heart, so I was hesitant to go into Koko. It wasn't that bad...the layout was much the same and they have redecorated the walls (but to be honest they didn't need the random splashes of colour) . The menu was good - both times I've been I had the chicken tikka sticks (it's a starter but big enough for a main) and they were yummy. 

Overall, it was ok. I still preferred Native State, Koko lacked atmosphere and wasn't the same...but it was ok...ishThis is what some might call the posher end of town, for shopping. The walk is lined with shops like Louis Vuitton, Reiss, Armani, Calvin Klein, Anna Fontaine, Kurt Geiger, Firetrap (?) and a Parker Pen shop. Basically, you need nothing but want everything. The Reiss here is lovely and the staff do anything for you. If all that shopping tires you out, you can pop over to Volvona and Crolla for a Belini - bliss.This is pretty much the only place in the centre of Edinburgh you're going to get your junk-food carb hit after a night out, and it's always busy at the weekend and during the wee hours. As a result they stock mainly fast-food......pot noodles, ready-made meals, pizza's, sandwiches, but they also stock most of your basic necessities.

At the weekends and on particularly busy week-nights, they have bouncers at the door. This makes me feel safe....until CCTV captured one of the bodyguards stealing my friends mobile phone right out of her bag.

It's a good thing that this Scotmid is open 24/7, but it attracts homeless and drunk old men all the time. I don't think I've ever been in here without the police.
Saying that, I always go back to get bacon and rolls for my midnight snacks.Prosecco on tap....need I say more?

oh ok  I will. This is quite a new place on the Edinburgh scene, and it was badly needed. It adds a strong touch of class and elegance to the city (not that it needed any more) and just brings total indulgence to it. It is really quite trendy  - wear your good tights when you come here.

As I said, it has presecco on tap. My heart is yours, Missoni.Maybe it's because my mum is an English teacher, maybe it's because I love to read books, or maybe it's because I'm a sucker for a bargain, there's something about The Works that I find quite charming!

The staff are friendly, the books are widely accessed and the prices are reasonable. The location is great too, right in the centre of town!! They sell other things too, like diaries and pens etc.  It's essentially a touristy shop, they have everything and anything.This place has been a long time coming, and has been eagerly anticipated! It's really cool too, and in one of the coolest places to be in Edinburgh - 4th floor Harvey Nichols.
Simon Woodrall, the man behind Yo! Sushi, really was ahead of his time with these restaurants - the idea is genius!
The food is good too, but to be perfectly honest I'm really not a sushi person. It was wasted on me, I didn't enjoy myself because of the food, but my brothers loved it. It's all down to taste!I love stationary. I love this shop.

It's amazing how many stationary shops there are in the city, and I think I love them all....but Scribbler is definitely in my top 3. It's full of beautiful people and beautiful things. They have great office sets - matching folders, pens, staplers and punchs. What's more, they have masculine sets too! So if pink floral patterns aren't your thing lads, they have really nice mens things too!

I'm like Sam C, I've found myself giggeling at the cards too. They're brilliant! If I need a card or wrapping paper for someone special I'll come to a shop like Scribbler - what's not to love?!I've often seen this from my flat and wondered what on earth was going on. Beltane! I was told by a roudy bunch of passers by!

It is exactly as people before me have said, it's a fire festival and a rave all in one.

To be honest it's not really my thing..yea it's really cool and it's amazing to watch, but not for me. It attracts hippy-esque groups and most of my friends have gone there to get high.....!!

It's nice to look at....and nice overall...but mehAll pubs on Rose Street are more or less the same, but they're all brilliant.
As Marj has said, they have all their reviews stuck up on their windows, which is a bit arrogant yeah, but it works. If someone recommends it, I'll go, and that is exactly how I found myself in Pickled Green. 
It's a nice place, nicely decorated and nice friendly staff. The atmosphere is really good too, really chilled.
The food is good too, although that's second-hand information I'm afraid as I've only been for a drink. Rest assured, I'll come for something to eat!I don't like bravissimo. 

You get sent this magazine and it all looks wonderful, great selection and every size in the world available. Then you go to the shop....their stock is skanty to say the least. Pardon the pun. So you're sent upstairs and instructed to give your measurements to the staff, who then go away for ages and ages and ages then they tell you they don't have it. Most infuriating thing ever! My mum is a very impatient lady - her biggest pet hate is queues, so imgine her disgust. 

Her parting blow was 'i am going to yelp about this'. Errr...ok mum. But the thing is, I had the exact same expierance and was equally as annoyed as she, and so I feel the poor yelp is justified.I love this cute wee bar! It's sitting so innocently at the top of Holyrood Road, it looks so normal, but it is definitely above average.

The bar is quite big, and they have the coolest bar taps I've ever seen in my life. They have countless beer taps too, I lost count when I tried to see all the names. They pride themselves on their beer and burger offer, which my brothers loved. Their burgers are delicious too - I highly recommend the avocado burger. It's not your typical pub-burger, oh no, it's just like something I would expect from a fancy restaurant in Paris.

It has a nice atmosphere too, I can sit here quite comfortably and do some work for my course without feeing watched or unwelcome.I am lucky enough to live directly opposite the Salisbury Crags. it's such a beautiful place, and so beautiful to look at.
It's one of the best things about Edinburgh, in my opinion. How many cities do you know with a great big hill 10 minutes from the city centre?!

I must admit, it doesn't do much for my self-esteem when I sit there eating chocolate and watch people run, yes run up the crags. Pfft.

If you're thinking about walking then ye be warned - it's not easy!! I had to stop 3 times, and I'm relatively fit, just to catch my breath. It's practically  vertical at times. Coming down is just as, if not harder on your knees as going up!
Beautiful views though!!

Don't mke the mistake I did - I expected to get to the top of the Craggs but the path just takes you straight back down to Pollock Halls!Boots is a great franchise, it's really really great value for money and always delivers. But not this one! I'm sorry, I really don't like it! It's really small and always busy. One of my favourite things about Boots is their really good lunch deal but they have always run out when I go in here! So I have to go to the much bigger and better branch on North Bridge. 
They usually have most of the stock (apart from Sandwiches)  and it's great value for money.Am I missing something? I LOVE House of Fraser!!

They have everything you could ever like in here. If it's raining, come straight here and you won't have to leave until 5pm. They have all the big names and all the small ones - they have Topshop, Warehouse, Oasis and lots more! They have a great little cafe here too, it's got a really traditional feel to it and you sit and watch people come up and down the sweeping staircase.

The main thing I like about this particular House of Fraser is the size of it. It's really big, but all the areas are quite small. So although you're in a huge department store, you feel like you're in a collection of small wee shops. It's nice!

Their handbag department has lovely staff - particularly Hazel and Lizzie (if they still work there). They helped me choose my mum's 50th handbag., and were absolutely brilliant!!I've been here about 6 times, and I've only eaten here twice. Why! I hear you ask. Well....it's always bloody closed. There's nothing more annoying than psyching yourself up for a nice bowl of soup or sandwich only to be turned away by a darkened cafe and a closed shutter.

Srtict opening hours aside, this place is alright. Nothing special, just alright. To be honest I don't really know why I keep coming back! I once had a really yummy carrot cake here, maybe my sub-conscious craves it.

It's a self-service, canteen-style set-up so you get your usual choices - mulch or cakes. The staff are friendly enough, they are observant with cleaning tables and things....but again, it's nothing special.Ok, I hear what Gavin M is saying, but you have no idea how good a girl feels when she knows her 'assscrack' smells like roses. Seriously, it's like walking on sunshine.

They have amazing scents in here, and all of them leave you smelling like you're just fallen into a fluffy rose cloud with sunshine and puppies. Unlike similar products, soaps and lotions from Crabtree hang around for hours so you can always remind yourself of how good your asscrack smells.Show me someone who hates Boots and I'll show you a man that can walk on water. Everybody loves Boots!! How can you not?

Their points system was revolutionary to the market at the time, and still is! I collect all my points throughout the year by making relatively small purchases (such as the amazing meal deal) regularly and can afford to buy most of my Christmas presents with the points I've collected. It just means that my brothers are going to get new razors every year, but hey!!
Their meal deal is completely brilliant too - a sandwich, drink and snack for less than it would cost you to get to work in the morning. Result!!Isn't it funny when food tastes better when it isn't yours? Well, there is a similar experience with the coffee here because you know it's fairtrade and thus better for the world. 
There's quite an earthy feel to this place, as you would imagine there to be, and the staff are nothing short of wonderful. Nice job.
Although the things they sell are probably on the more expensive side of things, it's worth it to save the planet from corruption and globalization, right?Ok so this sort of place isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's really cool! As Lynsey C said, it's really retro and really refreshing. How many vinyl shops do you know? Not very many, I'll say. 

When I took my mum in here she was giddy with excitement at being able to take out her old record player and have a boogie later on. They have a good selection, but nothing for my mum really. She left downhearted and downtrodden. 

Most of the records are around £3-5, with some more expensive ones coming in at higher prices. It is a niche market though, so demand is high.Have you every tried their peach loops? They're addictive.

I feel the same way as previous yelpers...when I come in here I always question my actions. Once i'm in though, it's fine! I always giggle to myself at the names I can't pronounce and the chicken that's probably Seagull.

All in all, it's a cheap supermarket and don't expect anything more than that.I don't just have a sweet tooth - i have sweet teeth. The name 'Lickity Splits' just sounds tasty to me! So it was a matter of time before I ventured in.

The shop is presented really well, it smells sweet (but not sickly) and everything has its palce. They stock everything from fizzy cola bottles to retro bottles of coke. It's quite a small shop and is a bit pricey, but if you are in for a purpose, as I always am, it's relatively cheap.
It's a lovely shop and the staff are wonderful. Their window displays are always amazing, if that doesn't lure you in then hopefully this will!This is a refeshingly cute little place in Edinburgh! It looks delicious from the outside, the bright red paint always glistens and looks really glossy - good enough to eat! And their displays are amazing!! At Halloween I spend about 20minutes looking at everything in their window, because there was so much to take in! It was closed at the time, otherwise I would have been in there in a shot. 
So when I did go in I was amazed at what they had! Blast from the past or what, I was taking a trip down memory lane as I was browsing all the candy they have in here.
The staff are lovely too, really professional and they enjoy their job, you can tell. It makes all the difference!
It's relatively cheap too, compared to the other similar places.
The only thing I didn't like was the smell...it was sickly sweet and made me feel a bit queasy!I feel like a bit of a hypocrite reviewing a tattoo parlor without ever getting a tattoo....but my friends have! And I've been with them!

My friend Shelly, who has a plethora of tattoo's, would never go anywhere else in the city for her body-art. She loves it. I have other friends who have been to other places and say that tribal is the best for quality. At the end of the day, if you're getting a tattoo, you'll want it to be of high quality!

When I first went into Tribal I was scared - I had these images in my head of a punk-rocker and feeling really uncomfortable in my bright pink jacket and pixie-shoes.  But I really didn't! The staff were lovely and let me sit and watch my friend get her tattoo. They were extremely professional and very thorough to make sure everything was going to be perfect.

I don't know if I'll ever get a tattoo, but if I did I would go to Tribal.My first experience of Holi Spice was an odd one - I had made an order for take-away and when I went to collect it their card machine wasn't working..so they gave it to me for free! With free popadoms. I felt quite bad though, and after eating the meal (which was delicious) I went back with cash.

The food is delicious. Really yummy and full of flavour, everything is made fresh to order. My favourite is the chicken korma, which is as good as any i've ever had.

As the Indian is also a restaurant, however, I always feel really uncomfortable walking in. I've only ever seen one table eating when I've been in, all the other times it has been empty. As a result, the staff are extremely attentive and were pouring over themselves to serve me, giving me freebies left, right and centre. I always choose to collect the food myself as I only live 5 minutes away and I like to think I'm burning the calories I;m about to consume (!), but they also have free delivery.

I really hope Holi Spice survives, it's a really good Indian and the staff are lovely.I always go through phases when it comes to games. Sometimes I am totally addicted to the likes of Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Maro kart, but sometimes I couldn't think of anything I'd want to do less.

It's a love hate thing, it loves me, i hate it...

But to be fair, Cex is a brilliant place for those phases where I love it. It's got all the games you could want, and if it doesn't have them then they happily order them in for you. As Gavin M has mentioned, it's a good  balance between all the other game shops on the high street today, it's one of my favourites. 
The staff are very knowledgeable and sincere, they want you to get what you want. They have a good deal too where you can trade in games, for a good price!!

They have everything you could want too - they have mobiles, cd players, ipods, most electronical items a young person today could want, they have, it's pretty good you,for good prices and really friendly staff.

The layout of the shop is good too they have everything you could want in a really easily-managed order. Well done Cex!Following the recent advertising slogan...I love Leith!!

there's something really grounded and down to earth about it. The walk down just summarizes everything I love about it. You can see as you walk down this road how it changes from Edinburgh-esque bars with trendy furniture and cool smoking areas to lovely pubs with genuine people and good atmospheres. 

When you arrive in Leith you've gone a full transformation from 'yah yah yah' to 'yes yes yes' to 'aye aye aye' - totally honest Edinburgh locals and in a totally enjoyable placeThis is one of the only Michelin Star Restaurant in Edinburgh. It's located off the beaten track (or in other words, down at Leith) and is something quite special to Edinburgh. I quite like getting in a taxi and going down to Leith, it almost feels as if I'm in a different city altogether!

The restaurant is funky, as my mum described it. It's nice, modern and clean, but maybe could do with a touch more excitement. But you don't go to a Michelin Star restaurant for the decor. The food was, as expected, delicious. The best part is there is always a good deal on to eat here, so you can get amazing food for next to nothing!
I had lamb with vegetables in an orange sauce, which was YUMMY and my dad had steak, which he loved. 

It's a brilliant place to come to for a special occasion!One word - Champagne Nail Manicures!!

BLISS!!

I can't tell you how much I love this nail bar. I feel AMAZING sitting on the white seats getting my nails done whilst sipping champagne. I feel even better when they throw in a free pedicure - which happens quite often! I always go with my mum (cos i feel a but wierd sitting sipping champage by myself) and we have such a laugh. When we are done, we either sit and wait around their seats and watch the beautiful people pass us by, or we toddle up to the 4th floor for a martini in our flip-flops and champagne.
People always comment when they see us and so they should - it's brilliant!!

It costs around £60 for a mani/pedi, contact them for a full range of prices. I would recommend one nail-artist but they are all as good as each other. And they are all lovely, really friendly.

I love this bar!Edinburgh isn't exactly known for its shopping. Infact, if I need to go shopping I'll get the train to Glasgow, because they have more selection and Primark! Being a student, Primark is important. There have been a few rumours that Primark will be opening in Edinburgh Princes St too, and I've seen the signs myself but nothing seems to happen!

Princes st has a great selection of shops though. Jenners at one end and House of Fraser at the other, you're just as well to spend the day in here. There is Topshop, H&M (two of them), Office, All Saints, Urban Outfitters and many, many more. Yeah it all looks good on paper, ut in reality it's a total nightmare trying to walk along the street. It's wide enough, so you would think there wouldn't be much of a problem, but my God I've wanted to punch a few people here. It gets too busy, simple! If you're not stuck behind the slowest people on the planet, you're stuck on a collision course with someone wanting money from you.

Although the shops are brilliant, I hate shopping on Princes Street because I have a very short fuse when it comes to being stuck behind  slow people or trying to thread my way through crowds! The solution is simple though - cross the road and walk on the other side!You can't help but laugh at them, can you!!

Sometimes I feel sorry for them though, like when a group of drunken lads ask the poor guy to cycle up the Mound or something for banter. Poor guys. But my mum and I once used one to go down the Mound...bloody hell it's scary! Plus they charged us £30!! They make a fortune, around £60 a night one of them told me (if they can be bothered). It is daylight robbery!! 

Kinda funny though!I have a story about this particular florists...

About 3 years ago, my ex boyfriend was desperately trying to get back together with me - I'm quite a catch, y'know. We had broken up before I moved to Edinburgh but he didn't take it too well. Anyway, I hadn't heard from him in a few weeks so I thought he had moved on...until I got a phonecall telling me I had a package at reception. It was an empty vase and a single red rose. The card just said 'it's a' . I was totally confused...but low and behold the next day I got another phonecall, another package. Another rose...this time the card said 'new year' . Ok, so I was beginning to get it. Every day for a fortnight I got a rose with more words on it, concluding to 'it's a new year, so let's try a new start? meet me at the witchery, sunday 9pm' . Cute , huh!! 

I was totally impressed with Interflora though, they were extremely professional and their customer service was brilliant. They knew that the overall message was - since they were sending it every day, but still enjoyed it alongside me.  They were absolutely brilliant.

You'll be glad to know I did go and meet my ex at the witchery and we did have a lovely meal. However, I told him we were never going to be together since he had slept with a married woman while we were together. 

All's fair in love and war.I absolutely love walking down Rose Street, no matter what the weather is like. On a  sunny day, it's the place to be and be seen in Edinburgh, sitting outside on one of the many, many bars along the street. There is a lovely selection of shops too,ranging from snow sport shops to underwear shops. There are lots of really cute boutiques too.

Although Rose Street is wonderful in the summer, to me it is best during winter. They have a beautiful net of fairylights overhead to you feel like you're in a dream world. It's beautiful!You know you love it really...

Picture the scene - navy jumper, purple triangles....yeah,you're in Pringle.

It's got a bit of a cult following, does our Pringle. A lot of my friends when I was in 1st year came here for their pub-golf crawls...they come once and realise that they can't afford to come again, thus use the same outfits over and over. Nothing wrong with that!

The price is hefty, not extreme, but hefty. Good quality though!!I've been in here a few times looking at their Thomas Sabo and Pandora stuff - which they have a decent selection of.  Whenever I've been in to buy something, I've never had a problem or any issue whatsoever, but whenever I've been in for a look or to ask a question I've been well and truly snubbed. 
I came in with my mum on Saturday to buy a Thomas Sabo Charm for a necklace, and they helped me pick and showed me the full range with their catalogue. I came in on Sunday with a friend to ask about their Pandora Bracelets and they weren't interested at all when I said I didn't want to buy one. They were verging on rude actually. I didn't realise the woman I had asked to help us was already serving somebody else and I was met with a cold 'sorry, I'm busy' and a turned back. 
Oh no she di-int!!!

Their stock is ok - Thomas Sabo and Pandora aside, they sell mostly costume jewelry which isn't really my thing. The shop itself is quite small so when it's busy it gets a bit cramped too.This Pizza Express took a while to get busy, but it got there! Eventually...!
The staff are lovely, really really friendly and are happy to help. I love coming here during the festival because there's such a variety of people.
The food is delicious too - I thoroughly recommend the Tuna Nicoise salad or the Chicken Pesto Pasta - YUMMY.
The service is generally really quick, but I once came here before going to a concert and had to leave my entire meal - but they did give it to me for free!
Overall it's a great branch to an already great restaurant!Meh.

This tour takes you pretty much to the main attractions.  It didn't leave me breathless, but it was alright. It was free, so I suppose I had built up a great image in my head but wasn't especially impressed. It was alright...! Good value!!This bus station looks really modern from the outside. Remember what your mum told you - never judge a book by its cover. And it has never been more relevant!!
Inside the station it's a bit shabby and run-down. When I was there, there was a lot of rubbish all over the floor and I sat on chewing gum. EW! The staff were a bitty snippy too, I was shunned more than once.

The busses generally ran on time, but I've heard some horror stories about sitting in the station for hours without knowing what to do or who to talk to.  But at the end of the day, it is a good service and a decent enough place!I found myself wandering in here one rainy afternoon, and I'm quite glad I did. It's one of those places that you always know are there and always walk past but never go into. 
When I went in it was near Christmas, and was looking for inspiration for my brothers. What do you buy older brothers?! Shaving balm from L'Occitane, that's what. (although it cost me an arm and a leg, more than I'd want to spend on my brothers...)
I bought both my brothers this balm and they loved it, it's for the pre-shaving ritual (apparently) and works a treat. I've been meaning to go back and investigate further....Duo - God's gift to women!

I could never buy knee-high boots because they would never fit my chubby calves, so I would always look on with envy all the knee-high boots trotting past me. It's funny how you notice the things you can't have.
Anyway, I was advised to go into Duo - and it's one of the best pieces of advice I've ever had!
The shop is really cool - they have really nice wallpaper and an amazingly HUGE mirror at the back. It's really nice and open too, so I don't feel like a sardine when I'm in here. They have a lovely selection of boots, shoes, anything you could possibly want! This is pretty standard for a shoe-shop, but Duo is not just any shoe shop...
They measure your leg and have all the shoes in different calf-sizes. Even if your calves are bigger than Arthurs Seat, you';ll get nice boots in Duo. It's brilliant!
even if you have really skinny calves, they have smaller sizes too.
Even if you have wide feet, they make their pumps to measure!

I really like Duo, the staff are lovely and I feel really at ease in here. I was a bit nervous, as I've lost count of the amount of times I've tried on boots and had to send them back because they didn't fit, but I felt totally at ease in here.
The boots I bought were quite expensive, but I wear then all the time and absolutely love them. It's definitely worth it.I love Stuart B's Mandela quote. It's true!! I was given a fish from here once quite recently and I was thrilled with it!! Everyone had a fish tank in the 80s and I fancied myself as a bit of an 80s chick. Thus, I was given a fish. I came down here to buy all my accessories - food, tank etc etc.  The staff were  lovely! But the shop smelled. Within a week I came back and asked if they wanted the fish back. Turns out the fish life isn't the life for me.I have had bad, bad experiences in Belushi's!

It's a total dive.....I know but I have to mention the elephant in the room, it's really not nice. It makes up in cheap drinks and great banter what it lacks in surrounding and cleanliness. But at the end of the day, if you're looking for a cheap and fun night out then you can't go wrong.
Belushi's is amongst a handful of places you can get wasted in relatively cheaply. It serves it purpose well...but is definitely not for me!This is definitely my favourite of the two H&Ms on Princes Street.  It is just the right size and it's never overly busy.

They have really great fashion and brilliantly priced! Cheap as chips! I bought two skirts in here the other day, one black and one grey for £2! I spent more on my lunch!

H&M is brilliant for a staple wardrobe, they have everything you could ever need/want and is good quality. They have brilliant jackets at winter and really cool bikini's in summer. What more could you want?!I was born in Buckie. For those of you not in the loop, that's 16 miles from Elgin. Thus, I feel a bit of a loyalty to the area, nothing much else happens up there!!

Elgin cashmere is great, it's mainly supplied from Johnstons of Elgin, so you just know you're getting quality.

The shop itself is located right in the middle of the Royal Mile, so hits all the tourists and has that appeal. The price is hefty, but the quality is good!!I always go through phases when it comes to games. Sometimes I am totally addicted to the likes of Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Maro kart, but sometimes I couldn't think of anything I'd want to do less.

It's a love hate thing, it loves me, i hate it...

But to be fair, Game is a good place for those phases where I love it. It's got all the games you could want.
The staff are very knowledgeable and sincere, they want you to get what you want. They have a good deal too where you can trade in games, for a good price!!Leith is the sort of place that I imagine Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts to stroll around in the movie Notting Hill. It's so lovely and soaked with history. The old, warehouse-style buildings make trendy apartments and the lined walkways are lovely.
It can be a bit of a nuisance to get down to, especially if you're only going down for a walk - as I often am. But once you get there, it's worth the journey.

Leith is in the middle of a regeneration project, the 'We Love Leith' signs are everywhere, to try to encourage people to come out and walk around. Although this is a good thing, part of me doesn't want more people around because it's so special just the way it is.I love this vue, mainly because there is free parking at Ocean Terminal. I've lost count of the amount of times I've paid the same amount for parking as I did for the ticket, so I get a sense of satisfaction when I come to this vue.
there's no reason why you shouldn't come here, really. Well, I suppose it's only really beneficial if you have a car, otherwise it's a but out of the way. But there are great transport links, what with the trams coming into place and all.

They always show the latest movies and is just as good as any other vue cinema. I always forget how far it is from the cashier to the actual cinema, though - it's up a biiig escalator and a few minutes walk, but that's no biggie.
There is always a queue too, both for the tickets and the food, so prepare time for that.

The only thing about this particular cinema is the heat - they must have it on full blast because I always work up a sweat watching the movies. Oh and the toilets are a bit messy, but other than that it's great!Yeah they have lovely shoes and everything, but their sale is amazing. Seriously, I walked away with a pair of Ugg Boots, black patent heels and yellow pumps for £35. I felt like I was robbing the place - I went straight home (taking the long route so they wouldn't follow me) and put them straight in my wardrobe - nobody is taking them away from me!! 

My black patent heels in particular have seen me well. My mum bought a pair of boots here recently and absolutely loves them, they are so cool!! The thing with Kurt Geiger, unlike most designer shops, is that quality comes before aesthetics. They are always made really well and are very comfortable. What's more, the staff are brilliant! They are always wearing some of the stock (which must be painful following a 8 hour shift) and make it look so lovely! One of the girls told me they had sold 12 pairs of shoes just because she was wearing them and made them look good. I am included in said 12.

As I say, it's a brilliant shop and has one of the best sales around. Don't go in pre-sale, you'll just hate yourself when you see the heels you bought with 75% off!What a cute we shop!! I use the term 'wee' with a big emphasis...!

They have the most amazing shoe collection but they also come with the most amazing price tag ever. They sell all the big boys - Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, D&G, you name it they've got it.

My mum told me that if I graduate with a 1.1 degree she'll buy me a pair of Louboutins from here - not that's motivationThis is a sort of Asian/European restaurant. They have sit-in meals and delivery too. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but regularly get take-away. And it's delicious!! They take pride in their food and it shines through each and every dish!
Their noodles in particular are delicious! In all sauces and styles, they are simply amazing.
Pricing is a bit expensive but as I say it's absolutely delicious so worth it!Delicious!! There's no other word for it!!

If you're into Asian cuisine then this is the place you'll want to go to. Their noodles are nothing short of delicious - you know how sometimes you get bored half way through your chow mein? Well not these noodles.

I want to try the Sesame Chicken Fried Rice following Amy's recommendation, but I have no doubt that it will be delicious.

The remaining star is lost because the price was a bit hefty, and I was told that I had to go and collect it myself....which I didn't mind because I had a car but I would have been really miffed if i hadn't.This Lidl is a bit out of the way, but hey, still Lidl.

They sell the most amazing sweets, their sugarland range got me through a few sticky moments when I was at uni. I can highly recommend their peach loops.

At the end of the day, it's a cheap supermarket and when you're in that mind-set, it meets expectations!!This place just comes across as desperate...sorry, it does. Every single time I walk past here BAR NONE i've been accosted and hastled by people trying to get me in, and I walk in this area a lot.
As Amy said, they don't really do Mexican very well. Upon one particular accosting, my friends and I, rather tiddly, decided ok why not. Big mistake. The tortilla's were soggy and the food wasn't really all that spicy. AND they did one of the most henus things you can do in my company - poured warm (white) wine and ran out of coriander.

Sorry Chiquito, you've lost meDune is the sort of place that can be brilliant or can be awful. Sometimes I go in here and think 'who the hell would pay £95 for a pair of pumps that will be ruined in the rain?' . Well, my mum - that's who. 
You can't deny that they have lovely shoes and brilliant styles, and the quality is very good. Ok ok, I might have exaggerated just a tad - their pumps don't get ruined in the rain. But I always frown at expensive pumps. 
Their heels are lovely, really good quality and really different. Their boots are particularly good, I have a lovely pair of brown patent over-the-knee that I always get compliments on. Cost me an arm and a leg though, but it's worth it if you know you'll get the good of them.

Also, if you're in this branch ask for Krystal. And tell her I say hello!When my mum tells me not to walk home at night, it is this specific area she's talking about! It can get really dark and dingy and really quite haunting!! Put it this way - the haunted tours in Edinburgh are set around the Cowgate.

There isn't much here from September - July, but it comes alive in August! One of the main tents is here for the festival so it always buzzing.  It is the best way to walk into the Grassmarket though because you get that tingly feeling when everything opens up around you.I always found it a bit off having a fishmongers in Marchmont, the hub of student living in Edinburgh. Students, who live off pot noodles and take-away, would never really bother to cook fish, but maybe they do.

Although saying that, most times I walk past Shiela's, it's closed! Maybe there isn't much business after all.

When it is open, however, it's a great contribution to the area. I came here and bought fresh halibut and prawns for a dinner party, and although there was a strong fishy smell (and my granny always told me if fish is smelly it's not fresh) I found the fish quite good! It wasn't amazing, but good enough for a nice meal.I absolutely LOVE Mai Thai! I live just around the corner from here and I always kick myself when I walk past because I never think to come here. It is located just off Fisherman's Close, which, upon my first visit, sortof scared me, but it's completely safe and I quite like the location.
From the outside it looks really clean and tidy and the inside is surprisingly chic too! 
The menu is to die for, there's no other way of putting it. I would be happy eating here for the rest of my life, working my way through the menu. The scallop and aubergine salad in particular is delicious, and their mixed starter to share is huge! My mum and I couldn't finish it.
The staff are lovely too, and they have free Wifi! 

Furthermore, they have a really good vegeterian menu too. Normally they only have one or two options, but they have an entire menu dedicated to meat-free options!

A normal 3-course meal for two (with wine) costs around £65, which I think is pretty good!

I can't recommend this place highly enough.Firetrap is the sort of place that I didn't think was anything special. I always thought it was a but odd to be in Multrees Walk - the Oxford Street (ish) of Edinburgh. I was wrong!

I should have given this shop more credit. For some reason I always thought it was a bit chavvy, and only sold jeans. But alas! It has brilliant summer dresses and really cool tops. It's quite an edgy shop, very rock n roll and almost gothic themes.
I bought a beautiful summer dress here last year for a really decent price. Some of the stuff is really expensive, roughly around £60 for a dress, but they have a great discount scheme and I was given a 20% discount card, just because I asked!
the shop is really trendy too. It's a bit dark, but it's big enough and has quite good decor.
The staff are really friendly too and there are always really cool window displays. Firetrap is fast becoming one of my favourite shops in the city!This is a real foodie sort of place in Edinburgh. They often have live music in the upstairs restaurant and always has a great atmosphere - but I suggest you book it if you want a meal!

It's lovely to sit outside Valvona & Crolla on a nice day, or even on any odd day. The seats here are always scarce, and always looks inviting to see people sitting out here, on Edinburgh's fanciest street.
I often come here to drink Bellini's with friends - although I must admit they aren't the best. In a place like this, you're paying to be seen.
You can tell the food is good quality...but it's wasted on lil ole me. I am not particularly fussy when it comes to food, but they serve French truffles and parfait of goat - give me a maccy d's anyday.you can't really get much better than Debenhams, no matter where it is!
They have a great selection of clothes, appliances....heck I'm not even going to bother to write the rest of it down because you know as well as I do what they sell and how great it is.

this particular branch doesn't have a Henry Holland though, which I was really annoyed about when I got the bus down here to but a playsuit from Henry Holland the other day....tsuh.

The staff are lovely too!

One of the best things about this branch is the fact that it's quite quiet, so plenty time to shop in a nice quiet and relaxing atmosphere!I must admit, where I was once quite taken by this brand, I'm now fed up and annoyed. yes, annoyed!!

It's EVERYWHERE!!

The price is excessive, the clothes aren't that nice and the shop isn't especially brilliant. Yet people love it?!!

I don't get it.It's a card shop. Does exactly what it says on the tin!!

Apart from cards, they sell balloons, novelty keyrings, novelty cups, toys - pretty much anything celebratory-related, they have it (apart from Champagne...gap in the market, you're welcome Clinton)

Although they are lovely at the time, I often feel hard done by spending £8 on a balloon that is great for the day...but gets tired and dies within the week. I think I would have been better buying  a mug.

this branch is a bit out of the way, but I suppose Ocean Terminal  is one of those places you get everything you need/want in one go - welcome Clinton CardsIf you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know I like a goo sandiwich. And I like Salt n Pepper.

As has been outlined before me, it doesn't look like much from the outside. As my mum used to tell me, never judge a book by its over - never has a truer word been spoken!

The staff are lovely here, really nice and happy. It makes a difference when they're happy, doesn't it?! 

As for the food - yum. Ok, it's not the most amazing food I've ever eaten, but it's certainly up there. It's a lot  better than your bog-standard sandwich place, it must be said.*warning - there are some really bad jokes and puns in this review about eyes*

I dropped in here after spying their 'drop in for a free eye test today!' sign outside. I was pleasantly surprEYEsied to see that I could be taken right there and then! I was in a bit of a fuffle though, my hair was messy and I hadn't looked in the mirror since the morning so goodness knows what  I looked like. But in I went, got my  test and they took my glasses to change the lenses there and then! Brilliant!

What's more, they had them ready by 5pm! I only went in at 3.30! I also met a girl I went to school with working behind the till, so that was nice! I also sensed some serious flirtation going on between the guy behind the till and me. teehee.Definitely one of my favourite places in Edinburgh!! It has everything you could ever want - amazing views of the city, a historical landmark and burns off some calories on the way up. WOOHOO!

This is also one of the best places to come at New Year. The atmosphere is totally electric and it's not really busy, so you can see the fireworks without being hustled and bustled into total strangers. Although this year it was quite frosty - bring a scarf if you're considering it.

Just writing about Calton Hill has made me want to go up. so I'm off! see ya later aligatorGlenha's is your typical British cafe! Well, it's a bit more exciting decor-wise, but it serves everything you would expect to get in one. Fry-ups, Bacon Rolls, Sausage rolls, tea, coffee, you name it. For that Glenha's, I am eternally greatful!!

I walk up here every other day to get to wherever I'm going, and the smell almost always tempts me in. It's easy, it's reliable and it's quick.this place is a bit odd. I don't know what it is, but there's something a bit funny about it. It's not a bad thing, but if you come in here you'll know what I mean....

The price is good, the stuff is weird and the staff are lovely. It's all quite surreal really!!This is the only applemac supplier in Edinburgh - which always baffles me! It's Scotlands capital and it doesn't have an Apple shop?? Get on it Apple!

As such, it has everything you want from an apple shop for the same price. You really can't fault the quality - apple are miles ahead of everyone else.

So I should probably explain myself...

I came in here with a broken laptop - as I have done twice before - I got the new guy. The new guy 'accidently' wiped my harddrive. To me, that's unforgivable.

As I had been in a few times with my broken laptop I assumed it would be safe! After they broke the news, they then told me it had to be sent away FOR TWO WEEKS to be fixed. Three weeks later, I got my laptop back. Yeah ok it had all the latest software and everything was up-to-date, but it wasn't my laptop. I lost all my photos, my music, my documents, everything! The frustrating thing is it could have been avoided, it was an accident. Thus, I will never forgive you Cancom.Nothing wrong with tanned, blonde beach-men is there?

aahhh........

This is one of those places that I would love to love, if you know what I mean? It's such a cool lifestyle, surfer by day, care-free at night, right? I wish.

This place is quite expensive though, it must be said. For what it is, there could be at least a student discountLike Stephanie, I received one of these amazing goody bags!! I was amazed at the quality of products so I decided to pop along and check this place out!
I wasn't disappointed, it's a lovely little cafe, really organic-feeling and has a lovely atmosphere. I sat and had a coffee here and watched the world go by. Unlike most chain stores, I didn't feel under any pressure and wasn't hassles every few minutes. It was lovely!!I like to think of myself as somewhat of a sandwich connoisseur...!!! My ex boyfriend told me  I made the best sandwiches he's ever had in his life....one of the reasons I broke up with him was his groveling nature!!

However, I wouldn't go out of my way to have a sandwich here. 

Their panini's are dripping in cheese, regardless whether you ordered cheese or not. It's greasy, it's small and it's a wee bit overpriced.

Not really a Super Sandwich, but not awfulI'm not into cycling at all, so this shop is definitely lost on me. But it looks good!!

If I were into cycling, this would be my one-stop-shop for everything I need. The staff are really friendly , I came in here for a look (to satisfy my curiosity more than anything) and the staff went more than happy to show me around even though they knew I wasn't going to buy anything.

Maybe it's because I'm not into cycling, but I found everything in here to be extremely expensive! But hey as I said, I'm a newbieI must admit...the pies in here are amazing. It's not often you'll  hear me saying I love pies (haha) but they are amazing here.

It doesn't look like much to a passer-by, but keep an eye out for this charming little bakery!

The prices are reasonable for the quality you get, so it's definitely worth a look!I fell in love with all the Quarter-mile apartments as soon as I saw them...and when I got inside then whoa!!! Hold me back!!

They mix the old with the new and have done it really well. Although it seems to have been on the go for years now, never seemingly finished! A friend told me there will be around 900 appartments in total, which is crazy. When it's finished it will be amazing!!

The flats themselves are quite expensive, but will be worth it in the long run as I fully believe it will regain its value.

They are STUNNING appartments though, worth a look!I see Cafe Anfora is getting a bit of grief for their bathroom....!! It's a cafe, not a toilet - the toilet is a minor detail.

ANYWAY, the cafe itself isn't too bad! It serves cakes etc, when I asked if they had anything for lunch they said there was a wee problem in the kitchen, they were lovely about it so I wasn't too bothered. Ok my scone was a bit chewy, but it was edible. My coffee was nice and warm, just how I like it, but I noticed some people turning their back because it was too cold. Uhoh.

It's not bad, but it's not amazing either, and the toilets make it different!This is the sort of place that every young person moving out of home need to know about. It's amazing. 

They advertise themselves as doing 'bespoke tailoring' and it's not wrong. Any tailoring pretty much!!
I came in here in a mad panic one afternoon after realising I had split a seam in my mums Karen Millen dress........sh*t. They could see I was in distress and were so lovely and comforting, and had the dress fixed within the day! I couldn't ask for any better.

They also custom make curtains too, which is really useful for Edinburgh. The windows in some of Edinburgh's Newtown are ridiculously big, so they make all the curtains there for you! 
They have a really good dry cleaning service too.

They are Master Tailors!This place represents everything I loathe in the lad culture. It's chavvy, it's generic, it's cheap and it's really not my thing.

There's not much more I can say really.....personally, it;s a total miss. But it might be different for you...This is definitely one of my favourite places to be in Edinburgh. The other Starbucks' are good- after all, it's the same coffee and the same products, but this is out of the hustle and bustle and is a lot quieter. You could be anywhere in the world  sitting in here.

I love it in here, I've spent hours just lazing away with a good book or just a coffee and my thoughts. Ahhh!!

The staff are really friendly too, I forgot my umbrella once and a poor guy ran after me in the pouring rain, and I was almost at my door. bless.Dalkeith Road is so sad-looking. I don't know how a street can looks sad, but it does. It's sort of saying 'I'm out of the way, I'm long and there are other roads parallel to me that are much better and get there quicker. sigh.' Is it possible to feel sorry for a road? 

Anyway

C's Tasty Bites thus lacks the va va voom I look for in a snack shop. It tries, nonetheless, and 10/10 for effort. 
The place itself is small, I think too small to breathe so only ever come here for take-away. The price is alright and the food isn't amazing, but maybe i;m lacking enthusiasm because when I leave i'm left with Dalkeith road. aw.Who knew Edinburgh University had a cinema? Not me....!!

But then again maybe I was better off without knowing that....to be honest it's going to disappoint you. I was expecting blockbusters, new releases, popcorn even....alas, it's not to be. 
For what it is, however, it's pretty good. Definitely looking into, and supports the University. It's big and the people there are friendly, but it's no Vue or Odeon..!WOW!!!

I drove past this shop on my way to Inverness, and I had to park to go and have a closer look. It was so f***ing cool!!

It is a charity shop for save the children, but completely unlike all the others I've been in before. I felt like I was in the gift shop of an art gallery, everything is kitsch and retro, and the colours are amazing. The whole shop is decorated brilliantly and it looks like something out of the movies.

Upon further investigation, I found out that the shop is owned by TV retail advisor and Save the Children Ambassador, Mary Portas, and it is infact a designer charity shop. I didn't know you could get them!

I plan to spend an awful lot more time in here.The Bruntsfield Hotel has become a trademark image to represent Bruntsfield. Its location is to DIE for, looking onto the links and meadows, waking up in one of their cosy, traditional rooms overlooking the stunning green parks is the perfect way to begin your day. Also it's no more than a 15 minute walk to Princes Street, so you miss the hustle and bustle at night but thrive in it during the day. The staff are very friendly and very welcoming, and they know a lot about the area. On top of this, the bistro is brilliant! Surprisingly trendy and chic! The furniture is fabulous and the decor is really cool. Can you tell I was surprised?! Shocked is more like it. The food was really yummy and the staff were great fun! It was really nice to be in such a contrasting environment - the traditional hotel and the trendy bistro. 
If you don't stay in the hotel, at least visit the bistro. Whether it's your first trip to Edinburgh or your second, there's no excuseThis place has everything you want really - you can easily spend a day in here and fulfill all your shopping needs!

Most people come here for one reason - John Lewis. But it has a lot more to offer - Timpsons, HMV, stationary shops and many more!

they also have a really good ice-cream stall and a brilliant pick n mix stall.
They also have bouncers in some places! I can understand why it would attract the less attractive customer (aka chavs) but the security makes me feel completely safe! I know the building is a bit shoddy and leaves a lot to be desired, but I quite like wandering from the ultra-high end Harvey Nichols into this place.

FACT - JK Rowling used to sell the Big Issue outside of the St James' Centre.Arthurs Seat is probably one of the main attractions of the city. It is not often you see a great big bloody hill in the middle of a city, but Edinburgh is no normal city after all.  

there are two parts to Arthurs Seat, The Crags and Arthurs Seat. Don't make the same mistake I did and climb The Crags thinking it was Arthurs Seat. Imagine my surprise. It's a nightmare climb yes, but hey it's only 20minutes of your life and trust me, it's worth it when you get up there. Ok, so it's a bit soul destroying when you are huffing and puffing up while spritely old men are jogging up past you...twice...but when you're there it's amazing. I used to go up all the time with my dad and our dog, it's a bonding experience and the dog is quiet for the rest of the day. However, I made the mistake once during a spur-of-the-moment trip up to the top wearing my new Ugg Boots. Bye bye ugg boots.

in the summer it's a great place to toddle up to with your pals, bring a picnic, and in winter it has spectacular views. It's the best place to be during the fireworks, and is a really special place to take in the New Year with that someone special. It is a nightmare to get to the top, but it's simply dreamy when you're there (....see what I did there?)I had to laugh the other day when  I read in the paper that Jenny Ha's was attacked for being a nazi pub. You simply couldn't get nicer people in one place! All the staff are welcoming, friendly and make you feel at total ease, even though there is a degree of locality to it. It is a nice, simple pub with a great atmosphere and really comforting. It reminded me of Christmas in a funny way. If you're visiting the parliament it's definitely worth a visit for a wee tod or a dram or two on your way back up the royal mile.There are no toilets in here!!

This is one of the first things that struck me about this Next. It's huge, yet there are no toilets. I would have thought there would be toilets.

Next clothes sort of guarantee quality though, the years of perseverance has taught us that, if anything. As I've said about other Next's, the potential is there but it's just lacking that va va voom...the x factor......that special thing. It's getting there though.
